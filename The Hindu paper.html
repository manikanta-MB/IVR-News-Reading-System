<a name="haryana-cabinet-nod-for-anti-conversio"></a><h2 id="haryana-cabinet-nod-for-anti-conversio"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Haryana cabinet nod for anti-conversion bill</h2>
<p>The Haryana Cabinet on Tuesday approved the draft of the Haryana Prevention of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Bill, 2022, which seeks to prohibit religious conversion effected through misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage or for marriage, by making it an offence.</p>
<p>According to the draft Bill, the burden of proof “lies on the accused”. The draft Bill will now be tabled before the Assembly, an official statement said.</p>
<p>Higher punishment</p>
<p>The Bill, on the lines of recent anti-conversion laws passed in other States, proposes to make conversion by marriage an offence.</p>
<p>It also prescribes higher punishment for conversion of minors, women, and members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.</p>
<p>The draft Bill’s statements of objectives and reasons read, “The Constitution confers on each individual the fundamental right to profess, practise and propagate his religion. However, the individual right to freedom of conscience and religion cannot be extended to construe a collective right to proselytize; for the right to religious freedom belongs equally to the person converting and the individual sought to be converted.”</p>
<p>‘Hidden agenda’</p>
<p>It added that there have been umpteen cases of religious conversions, both mass and individual.</p>
<p>“Obviously, such incidents have been hotly debated, more so in a multi-religious society, such as ours. The presence of pseudo-social organisations with a hidden agenda to convert the vulnerable sections of other religions. There have been instances when gullible people have been converted by offering allurement or under undue influence. Some have been forced to convert to other religions.”</p>
<p>It pointed out that in the recent past, there have been instances where to increase the strength of their own religion by getting people from other religions converted, people marry persons of other religion by either misrepresentation or concealment of their own religion and after getting married they force such other person to convert to their own religion.</p>

<p>As the row over hijab and saffron shawl is going on in the State, some students in a few colleges in Kalaburagi and Vijayanagara districts came wearing saffron shawls creating tension on the premises of their institutions on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hundreds of saffron shawl-clad students, both boys and girls, entered the Government Pre-University College premises at Mannur in Afzalpur taluk, Kalaburagi district, raising slogans and demanding equality in places of learning. The authorities concerned prevented them from entering classrooms. The students, who were said to have been backed by Sri Ram Sene, started arguing with the authorities and demanded that they do not allow hijab-clad girls into college.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of discussions and arguments, college principal Shantharasa Hosamani and other teaching staff managed to convince the students of the need to remain calm. The students obliged him and later took off their saffron shawls and attended classes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, hijab-clad girls were also asked to take off their hijabs and attend classes. As per information provided by Mr. Hosamani, of the seven girls who came in hijab, five took off their hijabs and kept them in their bags and attended classes.</p>
<p>The remaining two girls, who refused to take off their hijabs, told the authorities that they have to take permission from their parents and returned home. As a precautionary measure, the college was closed after three periods of teaching.</p>
<p>“It is very unfortunate that students who should focus on their studies are falling prey to vested interests and spoiling their own future. We tried our best to convince the students of the need to keep away from all this,” Mr. Hosamani told The Hindu .</p>
<p>In another incident in the same district, a few students, who were said to have been backed by Sri Ram Sene, came on the premises of the Government First Grade Degree College in Jewargi town wearing saffron shawls. They argued with the teaching staff when the latter prevented them from entering classrooms. The students, who were in an agitating mood, questioned the authorities why they had allowed hijab-clad girls into college.</p>
<p>Karighuleshwar Farhatabad, a lecturer, appealed to the students with folded hands and requested them not to create a scene that could lead to untoward incidents in the college and then, in the town itself.</p>
<p>One such incident was reported from the Government First Grade Degree College in Hagarai Bommanahalli town in Vijayanagara district. As per information shared by the school authorities, three students came to the college wearing saffron shawls. College principal Satish Patil tried to advise them on the importance of maintaining discipline and focusing on their studies instead of getting involved in unwarranted activities when they were supposed to be remain focused on studying. The students, in response, asked the principal to give the same advise to hijab-clad girls in college and left for home.</p>

<p>The Konaje Police have arrested six men and seized 3.480 kg of ambergris (commonly known as whale’s vomit), which is banned under the Wildlife Protection Act.</p>
<p>The police gave the names of the arrested men as Prashant (24) of Jadkal village in Kundapur taluk, Satyaraj (32) of Banashankari III Stage in Bengaluru, Rohit (27) of Tenkayadapadavu in Mangaluru taluk, Rajesh (37) of Addoor village in Mangaluru taluk, Virupaksha (37) of Tenkayadapadavu in Mangaluru Taluk and Nagaraj (31) of Kaup village in Udupi taluk.</p>
<p>The police said that accused Virupaksha obtained ambergris from a fisherman in Tamil Nadu. He joined the other accused to bring it in a clandestine manner to the city and sell it. Ambergris is used mainly in perfumes and it is in much demand.</p>
<p>Following a tip-off, the Konaje Police raided a place near Navodaya School in Balepuni village of Bantwal taluk and seized ambergris. The police said that they took permission from a local court to send the substance for tests at the Forensic Science Laboratory.</p>
<p>The accused have been sent to judicial custody, the police added.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the police here have seized ambergris. Two years ago, this banned substance was seized by the Uttara Kannada Police.</p>

<p>A special session of the Tamil Nadu Assembly on Tuesday ‘unanimously’ re-adopted a Bill that seeks to dispense with NEET for admission to undergraduate medical courses in the State. The Bill, previously adopted last September, was recently returned by Governor R.N. Ravi.</p>
<p>Moving the Bill in the House, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said, “We have not gathered here only for discussing NEET. We have gathered here to protect the integrity and the rights of the Tamil Nadu legislature. The philosophy of cooperative federalism is to protect the many communities, languages and cultures. We have gathered here to protect cooperative federalism.”</p>
<p>Except the four members of the BJP, who staged a walkout from the House, opposing the Tamil Nadu government’s decision, all political parties, including the principal Opposition party, the AIADMK, supported the Bill moved by Mr. Stalin.</p>
<p>Since all legislators present during the voice vote supported the Bill, Speaker M. Appavu declared that it had been adopted unanimously.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the House has re-adopted a Bill returned by the Governor.</p>
<p>The earlier Bill, titled ‘Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021’, was adopted by the Assembly on September 13 last year, when Governor Banwarilal Purohit was in office. Mr. Ravi was sworn-in Governor on September 18.</p>
<p>During the special session, which commenced in the Assembly Hall at Fort St. George at 10 a.m., the Speaker expressed his displeasure over the release in the public domain of the operative portion of the contents of the Governor’s letter returning the Bill to him [Raj Bhavan had issued a press release on the issue]. He questioned the time taken [by the Governor] for making a decision on a Bill that was adopted unanimously.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ma. Subramanian read out the reasons given by the Governor for returning the Bill and provided the government’s responses to each of them.</p>
<p>Last week, the Governor returned the previous Bill, contending that the legislation was against the interests of students, especially those from rural areas and economically weaker sections.</p>
<p>In February 2017, a similar Bill against NEET was adopted by the House during the AIADMK regime. But a few months later, President Ram Nath Kovind withheld his assent to the Bill.</p>

<a name="posts-on-kashmir-unacceptable-govt."></a><h2 id="posts-on-kashmir-unacceptable-govt."><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Posts on kashmir unacceptable: govt.</h2>
<p>Terming as “unacceptable” social media posts calling for Kashmiri “freedom” by various multinational companies (MNCs) based in Pakistan, the government on Tuesday went on a diplomatic overdrive.</p>
<p>While External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar spoke to his South Korean counterpart Chung Eui-yong to protest against the posts put out by Hyundai Motor Company, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) conveyed to a number of other countries that it found the posts “offensive”, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament.</p>
<p>Apart from South Korean companies Hyundai and Kia, the Pakistani branches of American MNCs KFC and Pizza Hut, Japanese companies Osaka batteries, Atlas Honda Ltd. and Isuzu as well as German pharmaceutical company Schwabe had carried posts expressing “solidarity” with “Kashmiri brothers and sisters”, and “praying for the liberation” on February 5, which is marked as “Kashmir solidarity day” in Pakistan.</p>
<p>South Korean Ambassador Chang Jae Bok was summoned to South Block by the MEA, while Indian Ambassador to Seoul Sripriya Ranganathan sought an explanation from Hyundai and Kia for the posts. “The strong displeasure of the government on the unacceptable social media post by Hyundai Pakistan was conveyed to [the Korean Ambassador],” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in a statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Bagchi said Mr. Chung, during his telephone conversation, “regretted the offence caused to the people and Government of India by the social media post”.</p>

<p>The creation of Telangana found an echo in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticising the way the new State was created.</p>
<p>In his reply to the motion of thanks to the President’s address, the Prime Minister said Telangana was created with the Parliament doors closed, without any discussion and pepper sprays put to use. He blamed the Congress party for the way the Telangana bill was passed in Parliament and compared it to the creation of three new States by NDA government headed by Atal Behari Vajpayee. No such scenes were witnessed then, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Modi reiterated that his party was not against the creation of Telangana, but the way a separate State was formed. He felt the emotions and the political decisions of the UPA government to pass the Telangana bill continues to haunt both the newly formed Telangana and Andhra Pradesh States.</p>
<p>Hinting at political motives for the creation of Telangana, he said the Congress still did not derive any political benefit despite fulfilling the aspirations of separate Telangana.</p>
<p>While referring to Congress’ claim that India was a strong democracy because of the foundation laid by the party, he was sarcastic towards the Congress leadership of yesteryears, saying elected governments were dismissed at will. Even the Congress leaders heading the Congress governments in the States were not spared if they did not toe the line of the ‘family’, he said alleging that the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh T. Anjaiah was replaced only because the ‘Prime Minister’s son was not received well at the airport’. He also referred to the efforts to replace the N.T. Rama Rao government in Andhra Pradesh. About 100 times President’s rule was imposed in various states by Congress negating the people’s will.</p>
<p>Call for protests</p>
<p>Reacting to the Prime Minister’s speech, Telangana Congress president A. Revanth Reddy said Mr. Modi spewed venom against Telangana yet another time and called upon the Congress cadre to burn the effigies of the Prime Minister. “When the Vajpayee government could create three States - Uttarakhand, Chattisgarh and Jharkhand why did it ignore Telangana, which was a much older demand,” he asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Revanth Reddy also hit out at the TRS MPs for silently listening to the Prime Minister when he was spewing venom on Telangana in the Rajya Sabha. “Why were they silent and why is KCR silent,” he asked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the NSUI cadre held protests at the State BJP office in Hyderabad against the PM’s remarks.</p>

<p>The II Pre-University examinations in Karnataka will start on April 16 and conclude on May 6.</p>
<p>The Department of Pre-University Education on Tuesday issued the final timetable for the examination.</p>
<p>The announcement of exam dates comes amidst a raging controversy over dress codes in colleges, with girls in some pre-university colleges in coastal Karnataka and elsewhere not being allowed to enter classrooms wearing hijab and boys turning up in saffron shawls as a counter to hijab.</p>
<p>Academic activity was already disrupted owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Language subjects</p>
<p>With the pandemic throwing the academic calendar out of gear, the Government had decided to reduce the syllabus by 30% for language subjects. However, for optional subjects, the examination will be conducted without any cut in syllabus.</p>
<p>Last year, the Karnataka Government had cancelled the II PU examination, while SSLC students had to appear for two papers based on a multiple-choice question format.</p>
<p>Before this, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) had cancelled their respective class XII board examination in the wake of the second wave of COVID-19. This had resulted in parents and students in Karnataka urging the Government to take a similar decision.</p>
<p>Impact on academics</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this year’s II PU exam timetable has raised concerns among students over the impact it will have on the rest of the academic calendar, especially with regards to entrance exams.</p>
<p>Some students have expressed anxiety over not having enough time to prepare for them.</p>

<p>A day after referring to the Congress as the leader of the tukde tukde (break-up) gang in the Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday continued his attack against the Opposition party by recalling its history of dismissing State governments in the past, intolerance towards any criticism against its leadership and accused it of being in the grip of “urban naxals”.</p>
<p>“It is being said that we are trying to change history. The Congress thinking seems to have been hijacked by urban naxals. We just want to improve the memory of some people. We are not changing history. Some people’s history is limited to one family,” he said in the Rajya Sabha, replying to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his Address to Parliament.</p>
<p>Mr. Modi answered the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, who earlier asked what would have been the fate of the nation if Congress was not there during Independence. “I will tell you what would have happened if Congress wasn’t there — democracy would have been devoid of dynastic influence, we would be rid of foreign influence, there would be no Emergency, no caste and regional divide, no Sikh genocide would have taken place, Kashmir Pandits wouldn’t have been displaced, daughters would n’t have been killed in tandoor [oven] and common man would not have had to wait for years to get basic amenities” he said.</p>

<p>With the row over dress code escalating in Karnataka, the Karnataka Government on Tuesday ordered closure of high schools (Class IX and X) and colleges in the State for three days.</p>
<p>The Karnataka High Court, meanwhile, commenced hearing a batch of petitions questioning the ban on wearing hijab (head scarf) in colleges.</p>
<p>The controversy over Muslim girls wearing hijab and Hindu boys donning saffron shawls being denied entry into classrooms took a turn for the worse on Tuesday, with reports of violence on some college campuses in various parts of Karnataka. There were instances of stone pelting, students being heckled and lathi-charge reported from college campuses.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is in New Delhi, issued the order on closure of schools and colleges and tweeted, “I appeal to all students, teachers and managements of schools and colleges, as well as people of Karnataka, to maintain peace and harmony.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bommai appealed to all those concerned, especially students, to patiently wait for the court’s verdict. He reminded them that they have to sit together in colleges and carry on with educational activities, and hence, it was important to maintain harmony. He strongly defending the recent order of the government on dress code in colleges.</p>
<p>The Opposition has, meanwhile, lambasted the BJP government for escalation of the issue and “colleges turning into battlefield.” Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah in a series of tweets said, “Hijab-Kesari issue could have been resolved harmoniously at the local level. BJP in Karnataka, which politicized the issue, is now clueless on how to control the situation.” He added that students were suffering because of “ulterior political motives of the BJP.”</p>
<p>JDS leader H.D. Kumaraswamy said the controversy has diverted the focus of the State from many challenges it faces and vitiated the atmosphere in colleges. “I appeal to both communities not to encourage organizations that are fomenting trouble,” he said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks during his reply to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his Address to Parliament drew sharp reactions from the main political parties in Telangana and Maharashtra on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In Telangana, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and the Congress took strong objection to Mr. Modi’s remarks on the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, demanding an unconditional apology. State Finance and Health Minister T. Harish Rao criticised the Prime Minister for “spewing venom” against Telangana, saying that the Centre had denied the State its due.</p>
<p>The Centre was insisting on electricity meters for agricultural connections to release the grants, but the State government turned it down, he said.</p>
<p>State Congress chief A. Revanth Reddy said: “The comments on Telangana expose that the Prime Minister has no respect for elected bodies or Parliament.”</p>
<p>He said the BJP had came up with the slogan “one vote, two States” in 1998, but deceived the people after coming to power the next year.</p>
<p>“The party which ensured formation of three other States did not keep its commitment on Telangana. The lives of 1,200 plus people, who died for the cause of Telangana, could have been saved had the BJP kept its promise of bifurcation then,” he said.</p>
<p>Responding to Mr. Modi’s statement about the spread of COVID-19 during the first wave, all three major parties in Maharashtra demanded an apology from him and the BJP for making “snide” comments against the State. The Congress said it would hold protests outside the BJP offices across Maharashtra on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Hon’ble Speaker of the House. Elections were held in the Province of Madras when the electoral system was first established in India to elect people’s representatives by the people. The Justice Party, pioneer of the Dravidian movement, formed the government in the first general election in 1920, when the country was under British rule.</p>
<p>All those who travelled to India from England to observe the working of the Madras Provincial Assembly remarked that the Madras Province is the only province in India governed by the rule of law and administrative protocols.</p>
<p>This is a significant day in the history of this House, which established such democratic values. We have assembled here to defend democracy, to preserve democracy’s dignity, to uphold the principle of federalism, and to secure the right to education.</p>
<p>To defend federal philosophy</p>
<p>We are not only getting together to talk about the NEET Exam [the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test]. We have gathered to preserve the Tamil Nadu Legislature’s sovereignty and rights. Federalism is a fundamental idea that truly safeguards the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of the Indian subcontinent! We have come together to ensure that the great federal philosophy remains intact.</p>
<p>I stand in this Assembly that has laid the foundation for success in upholding social justice, legal justice, oppressed people’s rights, the greatness of Tamil ethnic community and its language. And I speak with the confidence that this Assembly can and will definitely eliminate the social injustice of NEET. Today, we are here in this Special Assembly to propose a policy of social justice in education for the entire country, having been trained in the footsteps of our leader Anna. To quench students’ passion for medical education, we have all come together to work in solidarity and promote social justice.</p>
<p>NEET is not a system established by the Constitution. It was not made a part of the Constitution. The Medical Council of India mandated the creation of NEET. When such an examination was proposed in 2010, Muthamizharinar Kalaignar, the then-Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, vehemently opposed it.</p>
<p>Much opposed</p>
<p>It was also opposed by a number of Indian States. This examination has been challenged in 115 cases across India. Tamil Nadu is the State that is leading the charge in this direction. All of these cases were heard by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>NEET was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court itself on July 18, 2013. The Chief Justice of India delivered the judgment. The exam was subsequently abolished across the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>However, after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the election and formed the government, a private training institute reopened the issue. The Supreme Court heard the case of NEET. “Judgment is recalled” and “Hear this case afresh,” the Supreme Court said on May 24, 2016 after hearing the case. On this basis, the BJP-led Union government issued an ordinance on April 11, 2016, which quickly implemented NEET across the country.</p>
<p>Private training institutes benefit from NEET. The NEET Exemption Bill is being introduced for the benefit of those who cannot afford to pay so much for training. NEET is an impediment to the entitlement of poor and needy children to education. In their dream of becoming doctors, a barrier wall has been placed in the name of NEET. “You can’t be a doctor,” says NEET. “You don’t deserve it,” it says, halting one’s progress. That is why the NEET Exemption Bill has been introduced. I do not think I need to go into great detail about the abnormalities in that exam at this assembly.</p>
<p>So, to summarise, NEET is not a holy cow. It attempts to marginalise students from low-income families in the guise of merit. As a result, we oppose the examination and demand an exemption.</p>
<p>The question I would want to address in this forum is whether NEET, which has sent some students to the graveyard and others to jail, is really required. This is a question that has been raised by the entire student community as well as parents.</p>
<p>A detailed review</p>
<p>On June 19, 2021, a committee led by retired High Court judge A.K. Rajan was formed to investigate the issues and submit a report on the effects of NEET on poor and backward students. The public was consulted. On July 14, 2021, the Committee submitted a 193-page report to the Government based on those comments. They claimed that Government school students were unable to follow their dreams of pursuing a medical education.</p>
<p>I have formed a committee under the leadership of the Chief Secretary to provide detailed recommendations on this report. After careful consideration, the Bill exempting Tamil Nadu from NEET was enacted by this Assembly. We did a lot of study and were able to pass this Bill, supported with factual information.</p>
<p>The NEET Exemption Bill was passed with the support of all members of this House, with the exception of four BJP members. The Bill reflected not only the sentiments of Tamil Nadu as a whole, but also the Assembly’s notion of its sovereignty.</p>
<p>It had to be approved by the Hon’ble Governor, and he should have sent it to the Hon’ble President for his approval. Instead, he kept it pending for 142 days before reaching a decision — despite our numerous requests — and then returned it to us. In this Assembly, I must state unequivocally that the reasons he cited for rejecting the Bill were incorrect.</p>
<p>On June 10, 2021, the Justice A.K. Rajan Committee was set up under G.O. No.283, Department of Health and Family Welfare. The committee was made up of academics and government officials. The study’s terms of reference were also made public by this high-level group.</p>
<p>The public was asked to provide feedback to the committee. Hundreds of thousands of people had expressed their opinions to the Commission by email, mail, and petition boxes put in various locations.</p>
<p>According to the recommendation, NEET has limited the diversity of community representation in MBBS and higher medical courses by impeding the desire of those underprivileged of receiving medical education and favouring the socio-economically rich sections. The statistics for this can be found in the report as well. According to the survey, government schoolchildren, those whose parents’ annual income is less than Rs. 2.5 lakh, the backward (BC), the most backward (MBC), Scheduled Castes (SC), and Scheduled Tribes (ST) are the most affected.</p>
<p>The Governor criticised the study for claiming that NEET is “against merit”. It is worth noting that the report of the Justice A.K. Rajan committee includes proven facts rejecting this. Among those chosen so far, rural poor students have been affected. According to the research, those who studied in the Tamil medium in government schools are also harmed. At this point, I strongly advise that no one mistakenly counts those who benefit from the Government of Tamil Nadu’s 7.5% reservation as having profited from NEET.</p>
<p>The power to legislate</p>
<p>A five-judge Supreme Court Bench heard the matter of Modern Dental College vs Madhya Pradesh government . The Supreme Court verdict was clear: The State government has the power to legislate on student admissions to higher education institutions.</p>
<p>In a separate judgment delivered by Justice Banumathi in the same case, she also ruled that the law regulating student admission was within the jurisdiction of the State government. We passed the Bill against NEET solely using the legislative power of the State legislature.</p>
<p>The Governor has urged that NEET be made mandatory by the Constitution. According to the Constitution, any legal provision can be made, but only for the rights of the socially and economically disadvantaged. We are bringing this NEET Exemption Bill back on that basis. The Constitution is anti-discriminatory. However, NEET is inherently discriminatory. Social justice is emphasised in constitutional law. NEET, on the other hand, is opposed to social justice. The term “justice of the law” is used in constitutional law. But NEET favours the rich. The Indian Constitution is built on the principle of equality. NEET, on the other hand, is the polar opposite of equality. NEET is opposed to all of the Constitution’s fundamental rights. That is why we are requesting NEET exemption.</p>
<p>My pain stems from having to debate for so long about a dreadful exam that disproportionately impacts poor and rural students.</p>
<p>The return of this Bill has also put into doubt the right of our State of Tamil Nadu. This legislature’s sovereignty has been brought into question. The autonomy of States has been questioned. That is what concerns me. What will happen to the constitutionally mandated relationship between the Union and State governments? What are the rights and responsibilities of people of various races, languages, and cultures?</p>
<p>We passed a Bill on September 13, 2021 to exempt students from NEET based on the power we have. The Governor is required by law to reserve it to the President for approval. I expect the Governor to carry out his responsibilities correctly. That is the Governor’s responsibility, which is limited by the legislative power of the legislature, which is elected by the people.</p>
<p>I hope that the Governor will respect the sentiments of the people of Tamil Nadu and act in the best interests of the students of Tamil Nadu by sending the NEET Exemption Bill to the President without delay, which will be reconsidered and passed under the power conferred on the people elected by the Legislature by the Constitution. I urge everyone to support this Bill in order to defend the right to education, which has been denied for a long time, as well as the State rights of Tamil Nadu and the social rights of Scheduled Castes, tribals, backward/most backward/the oppressed/the poor/the marginalised/and rural peoples.</p>

<a name="rights-of-the-weak-duties-of-the-power"></a><h2 id="rights-of-the-weak-duties-of-the-power"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Rights of the weak, duties of the powerful - rajeev bhargava</h2>
<p>Rights and duties are conceptually linked to one another. There are no rights without duties. If a person has the right to something, it necessarily implies that someone else has a corresponding duty to ensure that it is not violated. For example, if an individual has a right to free speech, then it is the duty of the state to prevent its infringement. Or take the right to religious freedom of, say, American Hindus. Other groups, regardless of numbers or social power, have a duty not to infringe it. If they ever fall short of space for worship, the government should help fix that problem, facilitate its possession or use by Hindus. Isn’t it a shame then that in Gurugram only the Sikhs felt duty-bound to help ordinary Muslims offer namaz?</p>
<p>If I have rights which impose duties on others, then others also have rights that enforce duties on me. Individuals have as many duties as rights. Any individual who demands a right and expects others to allow or facilitate its exercise must also expect that she is equally duty-bound to reciprocate. This is so simply because, like her, all others have rights too. We are all rights- as well as duties-bearing individuals.</p>
<p>I hope it is abundantly clear that rights entail duties, that rights cannot be exercised without the simultaneous performance of duties. Because of their grounding in rights, these (rights-based) duties cannot be pitted against rights. No opposition between them exists. To say here that we must focus on duties rather than on rights makes no sense. What then could be meant by the proposition that we must move away from a rights-based to a duty-based perspective?</p>
<p>Duties against rights</p>
<p>It should be obvious that the framework of rights and duties discussed above is grounded in egalitarian assumptions. However, the moment we drop this assumption, this whole picture of rights and duties is transformed. To be sure, the conceptual relation between rights and duties remains unbroken. Rights continue to entail duties, but in deeply hierarchical, inegalitarian societies, only a few people have rights, while the many have duties to ensure the proper exercise of the rights of these few.</p>
<p>In patriarchal families, the father alone has the right to take decisions. This puts all other members under a duty to abide by his decision. Remember Amrish Puri in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge ? He decides, without consultation, that Simran, played by Kajol, is to be married to the son of his friend in a Punjabi village. And Simran has no choice but to obey, to leave her home in London and settle in India. The mother, sympathetic to Simran, is also duty-bound not to object to the father’s decision.</p>
<p>Much the same is true of caste-ridden societies. It is a misconception that the ancient Hindu Varna Vyavastha has only duties and no rights. The duties of Shudras and Ati-shudras to serve people of higher rank flow from rights possessed exclusively by upper castes. A hierarchical caste system distributes rights and duties unequally. Only a few have the most important rights — the right to be served, for instance; the larger population has corresponding duties to ensure that these rights are exercised without hindrance. Any infringement on the rights of the upper caste, especially the Brahmin, brings heavy penalties to the violator, sometimes even death. Similarly, in many Islamic societies, rights and duties are gender-specific, and unequal. It is the right of men to have their testimony in the court weigh twice as much as that of women who are duty-bound to comply.</p>
<p>In absolute monarchies, the King has unrestricted rights and all others have corresponding duties which increase as we go down the ladder of political hierarchy. Those at the bottom have the maximum number of duties towards the maximum number of people, all ranked higher than them. Talk of priority of duties over rights is rampant in inegalitarian societies. When people are asked to forget about rights and think more about duties, the subtext is that they should forget about caring for their own rights and concentrate on their duties to the few. In hierarchical, inegalitarian societies, where power is unevenly distributed, duties are often seen in opposition to rights.</p>
<p>Careful attention to the structure of rights and duties in inegalitarian societies reveals its deep connection to social and political power. Those in power have rights; those without it have duties. A transformation from a hierarchical to an egalitarian order does not produce a power-free order. Instead, at least in principle, such change generates a democratic distribution of power. It is this equality of power that ensures a system of equal rights and duties. Indeed, in egalitarian polities, more power means more duties. The powerless have rights, the powerful have duties. For example, it is the duty of the state to ensure that there is no poverty, disease or unemployment. In this context, any move to shift focus from rights to duties, to complain of undue emphasis on rights breeds the suspicion that democracy is being undermined and hierarchy reintroduced through the backdoor.</p>
<p>Duties beyond rights</p>
<p>However, one cannot altogether deny the importance of a moral discourse that asks people to attend to duties. For, quite simply, duties that do not oppose rights exist and they do not flow from rights but go beyond them. Let us take an example. A surgeon performs an operation. He does his job efficiently and believes that once done, he is under no obligation to be present in the hospital or talk to the family of the patient. Now, consider another surgeon who after performing the operation feels compelled to interact with the patient, placate the anxieties of his family. Abandoning an impersonal stance, he brings warmth to his interaction. His act flows from duties that are integral to his character, to the goodness of his heart, to his personal virtues, to his commitment to warm social relationships, and does not flow from any right of the patient. To be sure, the patient and the family have the right to the surgeon’s full attention when he is performing the operation. A failure to do so would mean an obvious violation of the patient’s right. But no right of the patient or his family is violated if the surgeon does not go that extra mile to personally reassure the patient and his family.</p>
<p>A society with people who take such virtue-based, solidarity-infused duties seriously is much better than one where such duties are not valued. If that is the case, it is good to ask people to go beyond rights and to think also of their duties to others, and more generally to society. We all have a duty to build a tolerant society, or to remain vigilant against potential wrongs of our elected rulers. These duties are not antagonistic to rights; they are moral, non-justiciable. Many such duties are mentioned in our Constitution: to preserve composite culture, not destroy natural environment, develop scientific temper, safeguard public property, protect India’s sovereignty and integrity. None of them are legally enforceable but they impose an obligation on all citizens, especially on those who occupy public office, to go beyond the call of rights-based duties.</p>

<p>While the overall budgetary allocation towards the agricultural sector has marginally increased by 4.4% in the Union Budget 2022-23, the rate of increase is lower than the current inflation rate of 5.5%-6%. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) report for 2001 to 2019 shows that, globally, India is among the top 10 countries in terms of government spending in agriculture, constituting a share of around 7.3% of its total government expenditure. However, India lags behind several low-income countries such as Malawi (18%), Mali (12.4%), Bhutan (12%), Nepal (8%), as well as upper middle-income countries such as Guyana (10.3%) and China (9.6%).</p>
<p>India is ranked low</p>
<p>The picture changes and rather looks disappointing when we look at the Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) — an index which was developed as part of the Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 emphasises an increase in investment in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, development of technology to enhance agricultural productivity and eradication of poverty in middle- and lower-income countries. The AOI is calculated by dividing the agriculture share of government expenditure by the agriculture value added share of GDP. In other words, it measures the ratio between government spending towards the agricultural sector and the sector’s contribution to GDP. India’s index is one of the lowest, reflecting that the spending towards the agricultural sector is not commensurate with the sector’s contribution towards GDP.</p>
<p>A comparison with Asia</p>
<p>Although the AOI has shown an improvement since the mid-2000s, as part of the general revival that took place in several middle-income countries, India’s AOI (https://bit.ly/3rBSorH) is one of the lowest in Asia and among several other middle-income and upper-income countries. Asia as a whole performs much better, with a relatively higher performance by Eastern Asian countries. China has been doing remarkably well with an index steadily improving and crossing one.</p>
<p>Similarly, in countries such as the Republic of Korea, the value of AOI has been greater than one and greater than two since 2005-06 respectively. Even lower income African countries such as Zambia, have commendable spending in the agricultural sector despite being a landlocked country. India holds only the 38th rank in the world, despite being an agrarian economy wherein a huge population is dependent on the agricultural sector for its livelihood, and despite being among the largest producers of several crops produced and consumed in the world.</p>
<p>The enormous spending on the agricultural sector by East Asian countries is also reflected in their higher crop yield. For example, the total cereal yield in India is only around 3,282 kilograms per hectare compared to 4,225 kg per hectare in Asia. Within the Asian region, Eastern Asia has the highest cereal yield of 6,237 kg per hectare. In China, even with an average land holding size of 0.6 hectares, which is much lower than India’s average land holding size, the performance of the sector in terms of crop yield is much higher than India. For example, the cereal yield is 6,296 kg per hectare, pulses yield is 1,815 kg per hectare and vegetable crops yield is 25,546 kg per hectare in China; the corresponding figures for India are 3,282 kg, 704 kg, and 15,451 kg, respectively. Both India and China are among the world’s largest producers of wheat, rice, cotton and maize.</p>
<p>A closer look at the budgetary allocation towards the agricultural sector shows that there has been a drastic slashing of funds toward important schemes such as crop insurance and minimum support price (MSP). Even with an overall increase in budgetary outlays, the allocation towards Market Intervention Scheme and Price Support Scheme (MIS-PSS) was only Rs. 1,500 crore. This is 62% less than the previous allocation of Rs. 3,959.61 crore in revised estimates (RE) of FY 2021-22.</p>
<p>Other significant reductions</p>
<p>Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) experienced a significant reduction to only one crore as against the allocation of Rs. 400 crore in 2021-22. It was allocated just Rs. 1 crore for the year as against an expenditure of Rs. 400 crore in 2021-22. Both schemes are pertinent to ensure MSP-based procurement operations in the country, especially for pulses and oil seeds. Furthermore, the distribution of pulses to States for welfare schemes has also been reduced to Rs. 9 crore as compared to the Rs. 50 crore of FY 2021-22 (revised estimates) and the allocated amount of Rs. 300 crore in the year 2021-22. Additionally, there is an overall reduction in Rs. 718.8 crore in total central schemes/projects, which may have serious implications for the performance of the sector.</p>
<p>While one can still argue that the capital investment in the agricultural sector is more crucial than price support programmes, there has not been any considerable and commensurate increase in the allocation towards capital investment, especially for promotion of rural infrastructure and marketing facilities. Allocation for rural development was 5.59% in the previous Budget and it has been reduced to 5.23%. The allocation of funds towards schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM KISAN), Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana, though desirable, will not result in long run asset generation.</p>
<p>Measures to implement</p>
<p>The intensification in government spending towards the agricultural sector is the key to attain the sustainable development goals of higher agricultural growth and farm income. The focus on development of irrigation facilities, urban infrastructure and development of national highways must be complemented with an emphasis on the development of rural infrastructure and rural transportation facilities, along with an increase in the number of markets, as suggested by the National Commission on Farmers. These measures will play a crucial role in enhancing farmers’ access to markets and integrating small and marginal farmers into the agricultural supply chain to a greater extent.</p>

<a name="tax-incentives-for-philanthropy---priy"></a><h2 id="tax-incentives-for-philanthropy---priy"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Tax incentives for philanthropy - priyadarshini singh</h2>
<p>Do people donate money to charity to get a tax rebate? The answer for most donors is ‘no’. They donate because they believe in the causes they support, or the quality of work that some NGOs are doing, or because they are committed citizens. Why then are tax incentives needed for the charity sector? Why should the government forgo revenue it can generate from taxing charitable donations? Do tax incentives have any impact on charitable donations? We don’t know the answer to the last question, as a study on tax incentives across 12 countries, including India, by the Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy (CSIP) at Ashoka University, in research partnership with the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability, highlights. This is because the impact of tax incentives on charitable donations has not been systematically studied in the Indian context. The only publicly accessible study uses data from the 1970s-80s, when tax incentives for philanthropy were more appealing than they are now because the overall tax rates were much higher.</p>
<p>A poorly studied area</p>
<p>Raising taxes is a core attribute of statehood. But remarkably, tax incentives for charity also have a long history. They go all the way back to the 19th century in some of the countries studied, and are also provided in countries such as Brazil which have a restrictive tax incentives regime for civil society. Despite this, the role of tax incentives in supporting civil society is poorly studied in most countries, The best studies are from the U.S. and the U.K. These are primarily econometric studies which measure the increase (or decrease) in charitable donations due to changes in the tax incentives provisions. These studies depend on the availability of tax and donor data to researchers. But in these countries too, the non-monetary impact of tax incentives is not deeply examined. For example, does the legal relationship that tax incentives create between the state and the civil society as a sector impact its financial health and stability?</p>
<p>It does appear that in India, financial flows coming through tax incentives are not the mainstay of civil society (CSIP, 2021). However, given the overall nature of the sector, they may still be very critical. Many NGOs in India are small and operate with budgets of less than Rs. 15 lakh a year (CSIP, 2019). The distribution of NGOs is also skewed: they are concentrated in States like Uttar Pradesh (MOSPI, 2012). Most NGOs work in the areas of health and education. For small NGOs in remote areas or those working on areas that are less recognised, the tax incentives status may still be important for establishing legal recognition with the community, government entities and donors.</p>
<p>When examined from the perspective of the government, civil society organisations have historically played an irreplaceable role in social development. Many government programmes have emerged due to a harmonious relationship with NGOs that have implemented an innovative idea. Governments have provided the scale and state support while the NGOs have provided the ideational energy and community experience. The activity-based learning approach developed by Rishi Valley in Tamil Nadu during the early 2000s is an example.</p>
<p>The signalling effect</p>
<p>The most important role of tax incentives as the regulatory and legal link between the state and the civil society is that of the ‘signalling effect’. It denotes that the state supports philanthropic activity and through its revenue forgone, actively encourages private actors to engage with public problems.</p>
<p>A systematic study of the impact of tax incentives is the need of the hour, particularly one on the various provisions in supporting philanthropic activity which highlight the many ways in which India’s tax incentives regime can be made more responsive. For example, countries like France have a credit-based system, which is more equitable than the deduction-based system followed by India which privileges high-income donors. Studies in the U.S. and the U.K. suggest that high-income donors are more sensitive to tax incentives, and a carefully crafted regime can be used to target this category of donors. We also need to take a re-look at reinstating other categories of taxes such as wealth and inheritance tax so that charity-focused tax incentives can benefit the non-profit sector.</p>
<p>Our new tax regime dilutes the state-civil society relationship by giving donors the option to opt out of incentives for lower tax rates. Saving the revenue forgone from tax incentives may not increase the government coffers significantly, but this will impact the perception of the NGO sector for an average donor. And if this gets done, here’s hoping that it is supported by research and rationale.</p>

<p>Hours after the Budget was presented, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao raised a heated debate by floating the idea of rewriting the Constitution. Mr. Rao has been angry at what he perceives to be “step-motherly” treatment meted out by the Centre to the States. He floated the idea of introducing a new Constitution to remedy the situation as the existing Constitution, according to him, has been unable to do so.</p>
<p>Addressing an unusually lengthy press conference, he said there is a Union List, State List, and Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. But the party in power at the Centre, whether the Congress or the BJP, is trying to usurp the rights guaranteed to the States.</p>
<p>As expected, the idea attracted a lot of criticism. Mr. Rao’s comments gave enough ammunition to the Opposition to project the TRS president and his party as “anti-Dalit”. BJP and Congress leaders held separate demonstrations in support of the Constitution drafted by B.R. Ambedkar. BJP State President Bandi Sanjay Kumar said charges of sedition should be filed against the Chief Minister as his remarks had the potential of creating “social disorder”. Telangana Congress President and MP A. Revanth Reddy said there seemed to be a nexus between the TRS and the BJP as the latter too has been working to change the Constitution for quite some time. There was scope for amending the Constitution, but the proposal to introduce an altogether new one showed Mr. Rao’s disrespect for Ambedkar and the sections whose cause he championed, he said. BSP Telangana unit in-charge R.S. Praveen Kumar called the statement irresponsible. He said the formation of Telangana was possible only thanks to the Constitution.</p>
<p>The TRS leaders hit back at the Opposition claiming that the thinking was not new. State Planning Board vice-chairman B. Vinod Kumar said that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had appointed a commission to review the Constitution. Commissions have been formed in the past to examine certain provisions of the Constitution, he said.</p>
<p>Former Central Information Commissioner Madabhushi Sridhar Acharyulu said there was nothing wrong with Mr. Rao’s idea. Referring to the original draft of the Constitution, he said Ambedkar had made it clear that every Article can be replaced, added or amended. The Constitution drafted by Ambedkar has lost its shape as it has been amended many times. The Centre has been consistently trying to usurp the powers of the State, especially in the last seven years, he said. The gazette notifications issued by the Centre notifying the jurisdiction of the Godavari and Krishna rivers without consulting the riparian States is an example of how the Centre is trying to have its say in the State’s affairs, he said.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Mr. Rao’s apparent anguish at what he perceives to be overreach by the Centre, it is hardly infrequent to witness Centre-State conflicts of this sort. In recent years, issues such as the 15th Finance Commission, the GST, land acquisition policies and more have emerged as flashpoints between the Centre and States ruled by Opposition parties.</p>
<p>The reality is that the Constitution has provided a mechanism for remedy of such conflicts in the form of Article 131, which accords to the Supreme Court original jurisdiction to deal with disputes between the Centre and any States. The application of Article 131 relates to the situation where the rights and power of a State or the Centre are in question.</p>
<p>Before reaching for profoundly deep-rooted reform proposals such as the re-writing of the Consititution, Mr. Rao may find it more politically expedient to apply for legal recourse already made available to his government under existing laws.</p>

<p>Senegal holding its nerve to beat Egypt via a penalty shoot-out (4-2) on Sunday at the Stade d’Olembe in Yaounde, Cameroon, to clinch its maiden Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) brought the curtains down on a drama-filled, and at the same time tumultuous, tournament. Egypt, led by the Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah, came into the final with big-match pedigree, having won the title a record seven times. The North African heavyweight had also won its last six shoot-outs and had seen off fancied sides such as Ivory Coast, Morocco and the host Cameroon earlier in the competition. Senegal, on the other hand, had lost twice in the final, but found a hero in Sadio Mane, another of Liverpool’s effervescent stars, who scored the decisive penalty. It was a redemption of sorts for the 29-year-old, for he had fluffed a spot-kick as early as the sixth minute. But the night ended in glory, capped by a celebratory lap of honour with his nation’s flag draped around his shoulders. So it did for coach Aliou Cisse, who had missed the all-important penalty when Senegal first reached the final in 2002 and was the coach during the 2019 final defeat to Algeria. The quality of football in the final was largely dire and was marked by incessant fouling. But the lasting impression will be that of delirious Senegalese fans celebrating the moment their nation’s name was etched in the history book.</p>
<p>But the tournament will forever be punctuated by unsavoury happenings off the field. The most tragic of these was the trampling to death of at least eight Cameroonians on January 24 at the Stade d’Olembe. COVID-19, which had already led to the postponement of the event by a year, played spoilsport again, scuppering many a side’s best-laid plans and preparation time. It also did not help that certain European clubs and coaches were reluctant to release their players in the middle of their club seasons, with Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp even terming AFCON a “little tournament”. It is true that European football currently occupies an exalted position, with its crown jewel, the quadrennial tournament Euros, next only to the FIFA World Cup. But to deny other continental competitions their due would be a severe disservice. One just needs to look at what last year’s Copa America win meant to Lionel Messi. Despite having won every trophy and every award at club level, the Argentine legend coveted success with the national team the most. It was a similar quest for Mane and Senegal, of overcoming doubts and barriers, to experience the purest form of sporting joy there is. Mane called it the best day of his life and it is impossible to disagree.</p>

<p>With the Tamil Nadu Assembly passing once again its earlier Bill seeking to exempt government seats in undergraduate medical and dental courses from the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), the ball is once again in the court of Governor R.N. Ravi. The Governor had chosen to return to the House for reconsideration the Bill that was passed in September 2021, questioning the tenability of the Justice A.K. Rajan Committee Report that had given its findings in favour of the the passage of such a law. The DMK regime has thrown down the gauntlet as the Constitution is clear as far as the Governor’s course of action is concerned. If the Bill is presented to him again, Mr. Ravi is constitutionally bound to grant assent. It is a matter of speculation whether the Bill will obtain presidential nod, but the episode raises a question whether the Governor could not have avoided the current situation by reserving the Bill for the President instead of returning it. After all, this is clearly a Bill that requires the President’s acceptance — the exemption from NEET is in conflict with the central law that makes it mandatory and, therefore, can only be saved by the President’s assent. Regardless of the Bill’s merits, the Governor should delay the matter no further. The original intent of the Constitution makers was that the Governor, under Article 200, ought to have no discretion, save in the case of a law that undermines the position of the High Court, which he is bound to reserve for the President’s consideration. However, the Governor’s rare use of discretion to question the desirability or validity of a Bill, and ask for reconsideration is now a matter of constitutional practice.</p>
<p>Some parts of the Governor’s communication to the Legislative Assembly Speaker seem to suggest that Mr. Ravi disagrees with the basis for the Bill, even though he is not wrong in highlighting a Supreme Court decision in favour of NEET. It is not generally desirable for the Governor to seek to match wits with the legislature’s wisdom on social inputs that inform policy. It will be useful to recall that the Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State relations observed that the Governor should not act contrary to the advice of the Council of Ministers merely because he did not like the policy embodied in the Bill. The attention will now be on whether the NEET Exemption Bill will pass muster. For one thing, the exemption may not be a solution to the problem of government school students not making it to MBBS courses in sufficient numbers. The situation prior to the introduction of NEET was no better. However, the issue of NEET being a barrier to access is genuine. There is no doubt that the mandatory nature of NEET on a pan-India basis undermines the role of State governments in medical education. As the main deliverers of public health, the States cannot be denied a say in who joins medical courses in government colleges.</p>

<p>New Delhi, Feb. 8: The British Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas-Home said to-day that, as the most powerful nation in this part of the world, India could become the sort of “foundation and basis” for a collective security system in the Indian Ocean region. Addressing a crowded press conference, he expressed the view that with its increased authority and influence, India was now in a position to play such a role in this sensitive region to ensure that no power had the monopoly of the Indian Ocean. But this was entirely a matter for India to decide whether this concept of collective security in the Indian Ocean area was something that it could usefully undertake in the future. For the time being, the whole idea seemed a long way ahead, in spite of the fact that India was obviously interested in the security of the seas which border the sub-continent. The Soviet Union, he said, had doubled its naval power in the Indian Ocean in the last one year, while Britain had been progressively reducing its strength to the point that now it had only a minimal presence there. Though it was possible to avoid a naval arms race through an agreed balance of forces by the Big Powers in this region, the question of verification would be a difficult, if not an insuperable, problem in dealing with the Soviet Union, especially when it was known that it was in the midst of a mammoth naval expansion programme.</p>

<p>Counter point</p>
<p>It is amusing that the nearly 100 minute long reply to the debate on the Motion of Thanks for the President’s Address in the Lok Sabha accuses the Opposition Congress party of promoting division in the country in addition to labelling it as the leader of ‘ tukde tukde [break-up]’ gang (Page 1, February 8). It is the Bharatiya Janata Party that is dividing the country on the basis of religion and language and pursuing divisive policies. It is the BJP government that is initiating steps to destroy the federal and democratic set-up of India. It would be pertinent to mention the speech made by Congress leader Anand Sharma in the Rajya Sabha: “... the country belongs to all”. (Inside pages, February 8).</p>
<p>D. Sethuraman,</p>
<p>Chennai</p>
<p>The objective of the nearly 100 minute long speech seems to prove the age-old maxim of giving someone a bad name. From that exalted position that he holds, and in the ‘Temple of Democracy’, it does not behove the stature of a tall leader to ‘pick and choose’ extracts from Nehru’s speeches out of context and try to make justifications. He should have refrained from stooping so low.</p>
<p>K. Nehru Patnaik,</p>
<p>Visakhapatnam</p>
<p>The pointed remarks against the Congress Party’s subversive attempts in trying to capitalise on national woes for its survival are apt. The Congress must learn to take the Prime Minister’s comments in the right spirit.</p>

<p>The Common Entrance Test (CET) to professional undergraduate courses will mostly be held close on the heels of the II PU exams, which will conclude on May 6 as per the timetable announced by the Department of Pre-University Education on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“To prevent disruption to the academic calendar like the previous two years, we had planned to hold the CET exams in the last week of April or the first week of May. But now that the II PU exams will conclude only by May 6, we will hold the CET exam shortly after that. Probably in less than a week after that,” said Ramya. S., Executive Director, Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA). When asked of the short time students would get to prepare, Ms. Ramya said both II PU and CET exams had the same syllabus.</p>
<p>The short gap between the two exams has left many students anxious. Varshini R. Murthy, a II PU student preparing for her upcoming examinations, said a week after the board exams was too hurried and not enough time to prepare well for the CET. “Doing well in both the exams is important. CET ranking is key to pursue a professional course and hence the ranking potentially decides my career. Just a week’s time to prepare for CET makes me anxious,” she said.</p>
<p>Manohar C., who teaches at a CET coaching centre, said though the II PU and CET exams have the same syllabus, the mode and approach of preparation is entirely different and a week’s time was not enough for most students to switch from one to the other.</p>
<p>Amaresh Kadagada, president, SFI Karnataka, said after two years of disrupted academic calendar due to the pandemic, they hoped it would not be the case in 2022, but that doesn’t seem to be. CET exams were held in July in 2020 and in August in 2021. “In 2021-22, the classes started regularly only in September, which would have contributed to some delay in II PU board exams. Holding CET exams as early as possible is welcome. But the students will find it difficult if there is no sufficient gap between the two examinations. We need to think out of the box and probably hold the CET exams before the II PU board exams. This will provide time for preparation and also not disrupt the academic calendar,” he said.</p>

<p>Following directions from the Centre, Karnataka Government has directed all ICMR-approved COVID-19 testing labs in the State to send 10% of all positive samples, identified from February 2 to February 28, for genome sequencing.</p>
<p>This is as part of a special genome sequencing surveillance drive to enable detection of new variants proactively.</p>
<p>Karnataka has been given a target of 10,000 samples in February.</p>
<p>“As of now, routine genome sequencing is being undertaken with 15 samples fortnightly from each district. However, the Centre has now instructed the State to conduct a special genome sequencing surveillance of COVID-19 with a larger proportion of positive samples,” stated a circular issued in Bengaluru on February 7.</p>
<p>“Samples of patients with international travel history (irrespective of CT value); representative samples from clusters / focal outbreaks with severe morbidity and / or mortality; seriously sick, hospitalised patients and prolonged hospital admissions should be prioritised. Besides, samples from cases of re-infection; breakthrough infections (in fully vaccinated individuals) and from COVID-19 death cases should also be sent for sequencing,” the circular stated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, following recommendations by the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), all District Health and Family Welfare Officers, Mental Health Programme Officers along with District and Taluk Mental Health Program (DMHP) teams have been directed to ensure uninterrupted availability of out-patient mental health services.</p>
<p>Hospitals can also practice telephonic consultation, telemedicine services and e-prescription as per the existing telemedicine guidelines provided.</p>

<a name="states-dress-code-guideline-violates-f"></a><h2 id="states-dress-code-guideline-violates-f"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> State’s dress code guideline violates fundamental rights, high court told</h2>
<p>The Karnataka High Court commenced hearing a batch of petitions, filed by Muslim girls studying in Government Pre-university colleges in Udupi district, questioning the ban on wearing hijab (headscarf) in colleges.</p>
<p>Justice Krishna S. Dixit, before whom the petitions came up for hearing, at the outset requested the advocates, “Let us keep aside passions and emotions, and go by the laws, the reasons, and the Constitution.”</p>
<p>Advocate Mohammed Tahir requested that four petitioner students of Government PU College for Girls, Udupi, be temporarily allowed to attend classes by wearing the dupatta, which is a part of the uniform prescribed by the college, in the form of a headscarf for now, as only two months are left for the end of the academic year, during the pendency of the petitions.</p>
<p>Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi said the issue is now not confined to only four students, but a general question of law has arisen on the right to wear hijab in educational institutions.</p>
<p>Justice Dixit said if no via media can be worked out, the court will have to decide the issue early as it is not a happy scene to see students marching on the roads every day. Pointing to how the issue is being widely circulating on media platforms, the judge said he found hundreds of messages from unknown numbers on his WhatsApp on ruling by various courts.</p>
<p>The court agreed to first hear a petition, filed by Aishat Shifa and Thairin Begum of Government PU College, Kundapur, as it has questioned the legality of the latest Government Order, issued on February 5, 2022, prescribing guidelines for a dress code for both government and private schools, and PU colleges in Karnataka in the light of the hijab controversy.</p>
<p>Senior Advocate Devadatta Kamat, appearing for the petitioners, argued that the petitioners are not talking about wearing burqa or veil, but only a headscarf while contending that wearing of hijab is an ‘essential religious practice’ prescribed in the Holy Quran. Hence, the State Government has no regulatory power as wearing of hijab is protected under the right to freedom of religion in Article 25 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Mr. Kamat contended that the right to wear a dress is a facet of the fundamental right to speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), and threshold of ‘public order’ should be extremely high to impose any restriction under Article 19(2). If wearing of hijab is a ‘public order issue’, how is that Muslim girls wearing hijab outside is not a ‘public order issue’ but it becomes one when they enter college, Mr. Kamat contended. It was contended that the GO violates the right to privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Mr. Kamat said Sections 7 and 113 of the Karnataka Education Act, 1983, under which the GO was issued, have no reference to a dress code, and hence the Government had no competence to interfere to lay down policy. He contended that the judgments of Kerala and Madras High Courts, cited in the GO, are not applicable in this case as facts in the judgments are different.</p>

<p>The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta has recently written to the City Police Commissioner seeking the latter’s cooperation in filing FIRs against those found to be digging up roads without requisite permission.</p>
<p>The High Court of Karnataka has been pulling up the BBMP over the poor maintenance of roads and deaths caused due to potholes.</p>
<p>Without permission</p>
<p>In the letter, Mr. Gupta has stated that the civic body accords permission for road cutting/ digging to utility service providers. However, many take up digging without any permission from the BBMP, neither do they take up road restoration thereafter.</p>
<p>The civic chief has pointed that a young mother lost her life on January 30 while negotiating on a road that had been dug up by the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) to provide drinking water and sewage pipelines.</p>
<p>Earlier, the court had also sought information from the BBMP on action initiated against service providers who had dug up roads without permission.</p>
<p>The court also was apprised by the advocate representing the petitioners of a PIL on poor maintenance of roads that in the recent past, nine persons had died in road accidents caused by potholes.</p>
<p>In light of these developments, Mr. Gupta urged the police commissioner to direct all police stations in the city to file FIRs based on complaints filed by the jurisdictional BBMP engineers against utility service providers who have damaged the roads.</p>
<p>Following the letter, the police commissioner’s office has issued a reminder to all the law-and-order police stations directing police personnel to immediately take action on the complaints filed by BBMP engineers.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the civic chief chaired a meeting with senior officials to review the directions issued by the HC and the State government.</p>

<a name="academic-calendar-already-disrupted-sa"></a><h2 id="academic-calendar-already-disrupted-sa"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Academic calendar already disrupted, say colleges</h2>
<p>The three-day holiday declared by the State Government in light of the ongoing row over students sporting hijabs and saffron shawls in many parts of Karnataka is going to have an impact on the already delayed academic calendar, say lecturers.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai announced the three-day holiday for high schools and colleges.</p>
<p>B.G. Bhaskar, president of Federation of University and College Teachers’ Associations in Karnataka, told The Hindu that the academic calendar started late and almost an entire semester has been lost. “We had to revert to online classes from January 8 to 31, following the outbreak of the third wave. Just a week after the offline classes resumed, this has happened,” he said.</p>
<p>In many colleges, examinations were to begin from February 21. However, it was postponed to March 7. “We need to complete the syllabus, conduct internal assessment and practical examinations by then,” he pointed out.</p>
<p>In a circular, the Department of Higher Education later clarified that while all colleges, universities, technical colleges will remain closed, the examinations scheduled during the next few days would be held as planned.</p>
<p>A lecturer of an autonomous college in the city, however, maintained that syllabus had been completed last week. “We had online classes until last week. The semester examinations have been scheduled from February 28. However, students will have to come to colleges from February 21 for revision classes and practical examinations,” he said.</p>
<p>Govt. blamed</p>
<p>Sithara H.M., state secretariat member, All India Democratic Students’ Organisation, blamed the Government for failing to nip the row in the bud. “Holiday declaration is just temporary relief. The government should take action to ensure that this issue doesn’t grow further,” she said and added that the attention of citizens should not be diverted from the many problems of the education sector, such as fee hike and National Education Policy. She called upon students to stay away from “divisive forces”.</p>
<p>Schools</p>
<p>With no clarity on whether all schools would also remain closed, parents were making calls to the schools. It was later that the Department of Primary ans Secondary Education issued a circular clarifying that only classes 9 and 10 would remain closed.</p>
<p>However, many private schools in the city have decided to offer online classes over the next three days. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS), said the holiday had been declared under unavoidable circumstances.</p>
<p>“We have already communicated to the schools affiliated with KAMS to facilitate online classes over the next three days, as the academic calendar has already suffered,” he said.</p>

<p>Over 90% of the adult population in Karnataka is now fully vaccinated. Reiterating that it is still a challenging task for the State Health Department to cover the remaining population, officials said the second dose coverage slowed down in the last few weeks with the third wave showing a declining trend.</p>
<p>From 51% on November 16, second dose coverage in the State shot up to cross 80% on January 6. It took over a month for the State to cover another 10% and cross 90%. The first dose coverage has exceeded the target population of 4.89 crore. Officials said this is because the target population is only an estimate of the 2011 census.</p>
<p>14 districts excel</p>
<p>According to data from CoWIN and the State Health Department, the second dose coverage in 14 districts is above the State average of 90%. While Bengaluru Rural and Vijayapura have achieved 100% second dose coverage, Kodagu and Gadag have covered 98% of their population.</p>
<p>Bengaluru Urban (including BBMP), which was the first district in Karnataka to achieve 100% second dose coverage on December 23, has achieved 86% second dose coverage.</p>
<p>The lowest second dose coverage has been recorded in Kalaburgi and Raichur at 83% and 84% respectively. At 89% coverage each, Davangere, Haveri and Bidar are inching towards the State average. The second dose coverage is 90% each in Tumakuru, Koppal and Yadgir.</p>
<p>38 lakh people due</p>
<p>Arundhathi Chandrashekar, State Mission Director, National Health Mission, admitted that second dose vaccination has slowed down in the last few weeks because cases are declining.</p>
<p>“As of Tuesday, we have nearly 38 lakh people who are due for the second dose. At least half of these would have already taken the second dose with another number. Such people have to voluntarily come forward and inform us so that they can be included in the fully vaccinated list,” the official said adding that the focus would now be on vaccinating children and administering precaution doses.</p>
<p>Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, who tweeted about the second dose coverage, congratulated the health workers and district administration for the achievement.</p>

<p>With a minimal hospitalisation rate in the third wave that is showing a declining trend, the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) has written to the Government seeking release of private hospital beds set aside for Government-referred patients.</p>
<p>On January 4, the State Government directed private hospitals to set aside 50% of their beds for government referred COVID-19 patients. PHANA president H.M. Prasanna said that nearly 10,000 beds in private hospitals had been set aside for Government patients.</p>
<p>“However, not more than 30 patients have been referred by the Government to private hospitals in Bengaluru. These notified beds are not earning any revenue and maintenance of these beds has been a huge financial burden on the private sector. At the same time, requirement and demand for non-COVID admissions are rising by the day,” Dr. Prasanna said.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to the Chief Secretary, he assured that if there is any eventual reversal of trend in COVID admissions, PHANA will make beds available for Government allocation within five to seven days.</p>
<p>“In the first week of January, we had set aside 50% of beds in private hospitals and nursing homes for Government-referred patients following instructions from the Government. As we have seen since last one month, the hospitalisation rate is very low and all these beds are lying unused,” he said.</p>
<p>The doctor said he will meet Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar soon.</p>
<p>Ever since the third wave began in the State, hospitalisations have remained below 5,000 on any given day. The daily new cases have fallen from 50,210 on January 23 to 4,452 on February 8. The test positivity rate (TPR) has plummeted from 22.9% on January 21 to 5.01% on February 8. Besides, active cases have also dropped from 3.6 lakh on January 24 to 72,414 on February 8.</p>
<p>Hospitalisation rate has also declined from 5% to 6% in the first week of January to around 2% in the first week of February.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, the State had 3,059 active admissions. Of these, 1,199 admissions were private walk-in patients.</p>
<p>While 136 patients were on ventilators (nine in private hospitals) and 435 occupied ICU beds (including 171 in private hospitals), 660 patients occupied oxygen/high dependency unit (HDU) beds and the remaining general wards.</p>
<p>The State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is also of the opinion that there is no need for reservation of private hospitals beds for government referrals.</p>

<p>With two judges on a Supreme Court Bench – Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and A.S. Bopanna – recusing themselves from hearing a dispute among the neighbouring States of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka on the allocation of Krishna river, the Karnataka Government has filed an application before the Registrar General of the Supreme Court for early appointment of new judges for hearing the case and early gazette notification of the Krishna tribunal order on sharing of water.</p>
<p>Justice Chandrachud hails from Maharashtra while Justice Bopanna is from Karnataka. They recused themselves from hearing the case on January 10, 2022.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai chaired a meeting in New Delhi with the legal team representing Karnataka in the Supreme Court on river water dispute cases, officials of the Water Resources and Law departments, and Ministers J.C. Madhuswamy and Govind M. Karjol to discuss various pending cases pertained to river water sharing disputes.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Mr. Bommai said the government, in its application to the Registrar General of the Supreme Court, has urged the Chief Justice of the apex court to appoint two judges for hearing the case in the next sitting of the Bench.</p>
<p>Following the Union Budget proposal on linking of Godavari-Krishna, Krishna-Pennar, and Pennar-Cauvery, the Chief Minister said issues related to interlinking of rivers were discussed. A decision was taken to urge the Centre not to formulate detailed project reports till States’ share of river water was decided.</p>
<p>The legal team was asked to convey the State’s stand to the Jal Shakti ministry on preparations of DPRs, Mr. Bommai said.</p>
<p>On Mekedatu reservoir in the Cauvery basin,Mr. Bommai said the legal team has been asked to file the State’s appeals before the NGT and Supreme Court opposing the Tamil Nadu Government’s objections to the drinking water project.</p>

<p>“I could not physically meet Mr. Nadda. We spoke over telephone and he said he would call me in about two days,” Mr. Bommai told reporters in New Delhi. He said Mr. Nadda had told him that he would give clarity on the issue.</p>
<p>When asked if he was in favour of ministerial expansion or reshuffle, the Chief Minister only said that everything would depend on the outcome of discussion with Mr. Nadda. Mr. Bommai, who earlier held consultations with Union Home Minister and key strategist Amit Shah, said he had advised him to hold consultations with Mr. Nadda.</p>
<p>Several ministerial aspirants, including M.P. Renukacharya and Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, have been publicly demanding that there should be early expansion so that newcomers get sufficient time to prove their mettle. A large number of senior legislators too are throwing their hats in the ring by publicly declaring their aspirants to get ministerial berths.</p>
<p>Sangolli Rayanna</p>
<p>Sainik School</p>
<p>Mr. Bommai on Tuesday called on Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi and requested him to affiliate the Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna Sainik School, constructed by the State Government for Rs. 189 crore, to Sainik School Society under the Ministry of Defence.</p>
<p>A committeecomprising officers from the Sainik School Society and the Deputy Commissioner of Belagavi district, who is the head of the committee, has already visited the school for an assessment.</p>
<p>Measures have been taken to ensure that the school complies with all the parameters fixed by the Sainik School Society, the Chief Minister said.</p>
<p>The CM, who earlier held consultations with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, said he had advised him to hold consultations withMr. Nadda.</p>

<p>If you want to break the monotony of working from home, there is a new experience on the cards. The Indian Music Experience (IME) museum in Bengaluru is offering an option to work from their premises for Rs. 250 a day.</p>
<p>After booking a seat, either by calling the museum or doing it in person, you can work there from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. As of now, there are about 25 seats in the outdoor cafe and the learning centre located indoors. On Mondays, when the museum is shut for maintenance, the seats in the learning centre will be unavailable.</p>
<p>The museum offers high-speed internet connection, free parking, charging stations apart from an access to its exhibits between 10 am to 6 pm. The workstations will be frequently sanitised. Since the pandemic, more and more people have been working from their homes. “After a point, people might get bored of working in the same surroundings. The silence, greenery, and the musical exhibits can inspire people and help them be more focused,” says IME’s director Manasi Prasad. “People working in a creative field, like writers or artists, will especially benefit from the atmosphere,” she reckons. “This ‘Work From Museum’ programme is also one of the several attempts by IME to reach out to the community,” she adds, “Instead of a rare visit, people can make the museum a part of their daily lives.”</p>
<p>If the turnout is good, IME plans to offer weekly or monthly ‘work from museum’ packages. To book a seat, call 9686602366. For more information, visit indianmusicexperience.org</p>

<a name="couple-found-dead-police-suspect-murde"></a><h2 id="couple-found-dead-police-suspect-murde"><span class="header-section-number">4.12</span> Couple found dead; police suspect murder for gain</h2>
<p>A 70-year-old retired pilot of Indian Air Force and his wife were found murdered in their villa in Bidadi near Ramanagaram on Tuesday. The police suspect that it is a case of murder for gain. Meanwhile, the suspected assailant, who is the caretaker of the pets of the deceased, is on the run, soon after the incident came to light.</p>
<p>The deceased have been identified as Raghuraman, 70 and Asha, 63, who hailed from Tamil Nadu and were working in Delhi. The couple settled down in Bidadi and had been living in a private villa for six years, while their children live in Delhi.</p>
<p>The murder came to light when Raghuraman’s son called up the security and asked him to check the house as his parents were not answering phone calls. Thereafter, the security guard came to the villa and found the pet caretaker at home. The caretaker was hired six months ago to take care of a stray dog and a cat.</p>
<p>He told the security guards that the couple had gone to Bengaluru and went out. The security guard informed the same to his son, who, on suspicion asked them to go inside and check. The employee took them inside and escaped when they found the bodies lying in a pool of blood in different bedrooms. On information, the Bidadi police reached the spot and conducted spot investigations.</p>
<p>Investigations revealed that the murder could have taken place the previous night and the accused had used a hammer to bludgeon them to death. The accused then ransacked the house to search for valuables and even consumed alcohol and stayed until the security guards came to the villa to check, the police said.</p>
<p>The bodies were shifted for post-mortem and will be handed over to the family members on Wednesday and a special team has been formed to track down the assailant.</p>

<p>The BJP has promised to double the per capita income in Uttar Pradesh, provide free electricity for irrigation to farmers, increase the minimum punishment for unlawful conversion to 10 years, and double the number of women in government jobs if it is voted back to power in the State.</p>
<p>Transforming U.P. into becoming the top economy in the country and welfare of women and farmers stood out among the top promises in the party’s manifesto “Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra” released here by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.</p>
<p>Mr. Shah said that the Yogi Adityanath-led State Government had fulfilled 92% of the 212 sankalps (promises) made by the party in its 2017 election manifesto.</p>
<p>Apart from free electricity for irrigation, the BJP has promised to modernise sugarcane mills, establish new cooperative cane mills, support the purchase of wheat and paddy under the MSP and ensure that cane farmers whose dues are not settled within 14 days are paid the amount with an interest. Targeting the riverine OBC castes, the BJP also promised to bring in a Nishadraj Boat Subsidy Scheme, under which boats costing up to Rs. 1 lakh will be given a subsidy of 40%.</p>
<p>Support for women</p>
<p>For women, the BJP said it will increase the support amount provided to families with girl child under the Kanya Sumangala Yojana from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 25,000; give two free LPG gas cylinders to beneficiaries of the Ujjwala Yojana during Holi and Deepawali; provide free transport for women above 60; double the number of women in public service and government jobs, and provide scooties to college-going women.</p>
<p>While the BJP government had already enforced a stringent law against unlawful conversions, it has now said it will increase the minimum punishment to 10 years of imprisonment and Rs. 1 lakh in fine. Under the existing law, violation invites a jail term of not less than one year extendable to fiveyears, while the maximum jail term is 10 years.</p>
<p>The BJP also tried to attract the youth by promising to generate an employment or self-employment opportunity for one member in every family in the State over the next five years. Mr. Shah said the State Government had provided over 3 crore employment and self-employment opportunities since 2017.</p>
<p>The BJP has also promised to double the per capita income and attract investments of Rs. 10 lakh crore, while vowing to fill all vacant government posts and distribute two crore tablets and smartphones.</p>
<p>Rural vote</p>
<p>The BJP also reached out to the backward castes and rural vote. If voted to power, the BJP would start a scheme named after OBC leader Kalyan Singh for overall development of villages, and run canteens to provide meals to the poor at minimum rates. It will set up centres toprovide free coaching to OBC students preparing for competitive examinations.</p>
<p>Mr. Shah lauded Mr. Adityanath for freeing U.P.’s politics from criminalisation and the bureaucracy from politicisation. “It was five years of development and achievements in all areas of U.P. The next five years will lay the foundation of U.P.’s future,” said Mr. Shah.</p>
<p>Mr. Adityanath said his government had established the rule of law in U.P. and today every woman feels safe in the State.</p>

<a name="will-catch-peoples-imagination"></a><h2 id="will-catch-peoples-imagination"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> ‘will catch people’s imagination’</h2>
<p>Vivek Bansal , the Congress candidate from the Koil seat of Aligarh, in many ways, is an example of what is wrong with the party in Uttar Pradesh and tells us a thing or two about electoral politics. Immensely popular, the All Indian Congress Committee in charge of Haryana won the Aligarh seat in 2002 but since then he has been losing at the hustings from Koil. The war horse is at it again, appealing to people to rise above polarisation in one of the most educated constituencies that will go to the polls on February 10. Edited excerpts:</p>
<p>Why have you not been able to sail through despite popularity across party lines?</p>
<p>The city gets polarised before the voting. It’s unfortunate that education doesn’t broaden the horizon. Muslims are in substantive numbers on this seat. As they constitute 1,23,000 people in a constituency of around four lakh votes, here, the minority is always under an impression that it can make an MLA on its own and flock together.</p>
<p>What do you tell them?</p>
<p>A section of Muslims believes they can get anything done by claiming persecution. This feeling of persecution has to go. The BJP cashes on it. I keep on telling them why do you keep blaming the government for issues related to faith. Sikhs were displaced but they came up very fast.</p>
<p>What is the role of the Congress party’s eroding base in it?</p>
<p>The party is definitely weak in Uttar Pradesh. Priyanka ji is working hard. There are times when things don’t click for a party but I think it will change very fast and we will be able to catch the imagination of the people. In 2012, I lost by 500 votes. You can call it a quirk of fate or maybe overconfidence on my part.</p>
<p>Is the idea of giving 40% tickets to female candidates working ?</p>
<p>On the face of it, it was a very revolutionary step but the groundwork for it should have been done earlier. My understanding is at some places a candidate has been put up just because she belongs to a particular gender. It could not catch the imagination of the public.</p>
<p>Do you think an alliance would have been a better bet?</p>
<p>No, the party is looking at a long-term perspective. It could further erode the base.</p>

<a name="congress-joins-meghalaya-alliance"></a><h2 id="congress-joins-meghalaya-alliance"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Congress joins meghalaya alliance</h2>
<p>More than two months after losing 12 MLAs, the Congress in Meghalaya has joined the National People’s Party-led Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA) government. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a minor constituent of the alliance.</p>
<p>The five remaining Congress MLAs on Tuesday met Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma and submitted a letter for formally joining the coalition government. The Chief Minister welcomed the MLAs into the alliance in the presence of Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong.</p>
<p>“We wish to support you and the MDA to strengthen the government’s arms and decision-making so as to ensure that our joined efforts will take the State forward, in the general interest of its citizens,” read the letter signed by the five MLAs, underlining their decision to join the government from February 8. The five MLAs are M. Ampareen Lyngdoh, P.T. Sawkmie, Mayralborn Syiem, Kimfa S. Marbaniang and Mohendro Rapsang.</p>
<p>Ms. Lyngdoh, leader of the Congress Legislature Party, defended the move. “In this day and age, you can only save yourselves. The five of us are protecting each other,” she said.</p>
<p>She also deflected questions on the Congress becoming an ally of the BJP by virtue of joining the alliance.</p>
<p>Along with Nagaland and Tripura, Assembly elections in Meghalaya are due by February 2023.</p>
<p>The Congress had won 21 constituencies in the 2018 Assembly elections in Meghalaya but its seat count went down to 17, of whom 12 joined the Trinamool Congress in November 2021.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Congress and the BJP have come together, directly or indirectly, in the northeast.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked doctors, mostly final year medical students who had served as frontline workers in COVID-19 wards, to approach the government with a request to extend the deadline fixed for completion of their internship programme.</p>
<p>The completion of internship is a prerequisite for taking the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test - Post Graduate (NEET-PG) 2022.</p>
<p>These doctors, who risked their lives during the pandemic, want more time to complete their internship and take the NEET-PG exam. The deadline for completing the internship is May 31.</p>
<p>However, COVID-19 duties and the fact that different States follow different timelines for their internship programmes have made it impossible for the petitioner-doctors to finish up in time for the exam on May 31.</p>
<p>“Many candidates such as the petitioners joined COVID-19 duties as a result of which the period of their internship was postponed... Besides, different institutions in different States have different dates for the commencement of the internship and many of those dates would end beyond the cut-off which has been prescribed, resulting in the loss of a year,” senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for the petitioners, submitted.</p>
<p>Matter of policy</p>
<p>A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud agreed to the seriousness of the issue but said the court would not intervene in such matter of policy. The Bench instead gave the petitioners liberty to directly write to the Health Ministry.</p>
<p>“Since the issue which has been raised by the petitioners require some element of determining facts as well as aspects of policy, we are of the view that the ends of justice will be met by permitting the petitioners to submit a representation to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare [MoHFW], setting out the nature of the hardship,” the court said in the order. The Bench then asked the Ministry to take a decision on the representation by the petitioners, if they ever get around to file it, within a week.</p>
<p>“We request that the representation be considered expeditiously within one week of its submissions. We may also clarify that in view of the fact that the court is leaving it open to the petitioners to move the MoHFW, no opinion is expressed on the merits of the matter,” the Bench noted.</p>
<p>‘Manifestly arbitrary’</p>
<p>The petition had argued that the deadline of May 31, 2022, provided under Clause 4.1 and 4.2 of the Information Bulletin for NEET-PG 2022, was manifestly arbitrary as it deprived thousands of candidates to apply for the examination.</p>
<p>The exam was earlier scheduled for March 12.</p>

<p>His political detractors have dubbed him Goa’s ‘accidental Chief Minister’, a ‘puppet’ of the BJP central leadership and ‘property Sawant’. He has faced opposition within his own party while political commentators have found him insipid.</p>
<p>For all the harsh epithets hurled at him, Goa’s Chief Minister has remained unfazed as the party goes to the polls on February 14 for the first time without Manohar Parrikar. Seeking re-election from Sanquelim for a third time, he has chosen to exhibit his government’s efforts at building the State’s infrastructure, be it the bridge under construction on the Zuari river, the bypass at Canacona or the greenfield airport at Mopa.</p>
<p>While his electoral career began with a crash after he lost a 2008 bypoll from Pale, Mr. Sawant nonetheless rallied to win the 2012 election with a comfortable margin of nearly 7,000 votes from Sanquelim.</p>
<p>In 2017, he won a stiff contest with the Congress’s Dharmesh Saglani. His victory margin was much less than in 2012 – a little over 2,000 votes, with his vote share plummeting by nearly 23%. Mr. Sawant again faces off with Mr. Saglani as well as potential vote-cutters from the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and the Revolutionary Goans (RG) in the rural parts of Sanquelim, which constitutes Mr. Sawant’s primary base.</p>
<p>Mr. Sawant took over in March 2019 following Mr. Parrikar’s untimely demise. The contrast between both could not have been starker: Though both are from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh cadre, Mr. Sawant, an ayurvedic practitioner, is viewed as a docile ‘yes-man’ of the BJP top brass in Delhi.</p>
<p>While Parrikar commanded respect from opponents and his own partymen as well as from all social sections of society as a leader capable of acting independently.</p>
<p>Others see Mr. Sawant as a ‘grey eminence’, crediting him for engineering the defection of Congress and MGP legislators.</p>
<p>Through it all, Mr. Sawant has maintained that his government’s development works over a decade in power will see the BJP through and win absolute majority in this election.</p>
<p>Strong challenger</p>
<p>In his own constituency, Mr. Saglani has emerged as a strong challenger after dealing a jolt to the Chief Minister when the former managed to win the Sankhali Municipal Council.</p>
<p>But for Mr. Sawant, the most serious challenge is from within the BJP ranks in the form of his Cabinet colleague Vishwajit Rane — veteran Congressman Pratapsingh Rane’s son and Health Minister — who switched over from the Congress.</p>
<p>Mr. Rane’s chief ministerial ambitions are no secret. The two leaders have frequently clashed over a number of issues at Cabinet meetings — a clash threatened to split the party on the government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The newly appointed Vice- Chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Santishree Dhulipudi Pandit has distanced herself from a controversial Twitter account in her name a day after her appointment. In a response on Tuesday to The Hindu ’s query about whether the unverified handle @SantishreeD belonged to her, she said “Not mine”.</p>
<p>After Dr. Pandit’s appointment was announced on Monday, the account, which used her full name and description as a professor, caused widespread outrage on Twitter. Screenshots of tweets using communal language and name-calling students, farmers, politicians and activists went viral on social media.</p>
<p>Dr. Pandit did not respond to further queries from The Hindu on whether she was aware of who was using the account and whether she had requested its deletion.</p>
<p>The account included tweets referring to a section of JNU teachers and students as “losers” and “extremist naxal groups” who should be banned from campuses.</p>
<p>Tweets termed so-called “love jihad” a “terror by other means”, Sunni Islam radical.</p>
<p>Criticism of China</p>
<p>China also came in for a lot of flak, being termed a “rogue nation”. Tweets referred to COVID-19 as the China virus and accused the country of “bioterror” and “biowarfare”.</p>
<p>In domestic politics, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi was repeatedly referred to as an “Italian remote control” and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal a “pathological liar”, with a tweet adding that no Hindu must vote for him. Protesting farm unions were described as parasitic middlemen, riffraff and liars.</p>

<a name="punjabs-colour-coded-politics"></a><h2 id="punjabs-colour-coded-politics"><span class="header-section-number">5.8</span> Punjab’s colour-coded politics</h2>
<p>As electioneering intensifies in Punjab in the run-up to the Assembly election on February 20 , a new factor has emerged, adding colour to the political rivalry. The distinct colours of turbans, an intrinsic part of the Sikh religion and culture, are setting the tone for the elections as they are seen as symbols of political affiliation.</p>
<p>The century-old Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is associated with the blue colour, the Aam Aadmi Party connects with yellow, while the Congressmen favour white or light blue turbans.</p>
<p>The colour of turbans at political rallies are a way of signifying the political narrative, besides a show of strength and display of alignment by the supporters of political parties.</p>
<p>The SAD cadre initially were associated with black turbans as a mark of protest against the British during the ‘Morcha Chabian’, a campaign for the recovery of the keys of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) treasury in the early 1920s.</p>
<p>In the later years, the SAD inclined towards the blue and orange ( kesari ), which is allied with the ‘Panthic’ (Sikhism) ideology.</p>
<p>Bhagwant Mann, State president of the AAP and Lok Sabha member, who has been announced as the party’s chief ministerial candidate, has led the party’s association with yellow, which members said symbolises ‘revolution’.</p>
<p>According to the party members, the colour is associated with basant, or spring, the season of renewal after winter.</p>
<p>Congress leaders and cadre have been traditionally sported white turbans to differentiate themselves from the Akali Dal. Congress leaders, including former President Giani Zail Singh, former Chief Ministers Pratap Singh Kairon and Beant Singh, were mostly seen donning the white turban. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, however, was among those who wore a distinct light blue turban.</p>

<p>A search and rescue team on Tuesday recovered the bodies of seven soldiers who went missing on February 6 after an avalanche near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Harsh Wardhan Pande, the Defence spokesperson based in central Assam’s Tezpur, said the bodies of the Army personnel from the 19 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles were located at an altitude of 14,500 ft above sea level.</p>
<p>“The area had been witnessing inclement weather with heavy snowfall since the last few days. The bodies of the soldiers are currently being transferred from the avalanche site to the nearest Army medical facility for further formalities,” he said.</p>
<p>Search and rescue operations, including airlifting specialised teams, had been launched immediately after the avalanche struck the Mummy Head area in the Tawang district where the soldiers were patrolling in sub-zero conditions.</p>
<p>Mummy Head is about 35 km from Jangda Basti, the nearest village under the Jang police station. A local police team had also helped in the search and rescue operations.</p>

<p>After a protracted trial that lasted almost 13 years, a special court has delivered its verdict, holding 49 accused guilty in the 2008 serial blasts case in which Ahmedabad was rocked by a series of bomb blasts that left 56 dead and leaving 200 injured.</p>
<p>The court acquitted 28 accused in the case. As many as 77 accused are facing trial in the case.</p>
<p>The special court to hear quantum of punishment on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the verdict, the Court held guilty included Safdar Nagori, Javed Ahmed and Atikur Rehman. Among those acquitted were Mohammad Irfan, Nasir Ahmad and Shakeel Ahmed.</p>
<p>The 49 accused were convicted under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), Explosive Substances Act and the Damage to Public Property Act.</p>
<p>One accused was also convicted under the Arms Act. The accused were convicted under IPC sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 121 (a) (conspiracy to wage war or attempt to wage war against the nation) and 124 (a) (sedition), and section 16(1)(a)(b) of the UAPA, which concerns terrorist acts.</p>
<p>According to the Special Public Prosecutor Amit Patel, the convicts can attract a maximum punishment of death or imprisonment for life, and the prosecution will seek capital punishment for some of them.</p>
<p>The trial in the case ended in September last year. The special judge A.R. Patel has delivered the verdict in the most high-profile serial blasts case in Gujarat.</p>
<p>Earlier, the case was notified several times for pronouncement of judgment, but was adjourned.</p>
<p>In 2008, after the serial blasts, the Gujarat Police busted a nationwide network of radical elements from a minority community, who where involved in carrying out serial blasts in the city.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the police had claimed people associated with banned terror outfit Indian Mujahideen (IM), a faction of radicals of the outlawed Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), were allegedly involved in carrying out the serial blasts in which 56 innocent people were killed and over 200 had sustained serious injuries.</p>
<p>The police had also alleged that the terrorists associated with IM had planned and executed the blasts as a revenge for the 2002 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat.</p>
<p>During the lengthy trial that had begun in 2009, a year after the blasts, the prosecution examined over 1,100 witnesses.</p>
<p>The trial in this sensitive case initially took place inside the Sabarmati central jail for security reasons and the proceedings were later conducted mostly through video-conferencing.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday disposed of a curative petition concerning the row between Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. (GUVNL), the State’s power utility, and Adani Group’s power company after noting that both parties had reached an amicable out-of-court settlement and their relationship would be governed by the terms of the compromise.</p>
<p>A Special Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana passed the order in a curative petition filed by the GUVNL against a July 2019 judgment of the Supreme Court upholding the termination of a power purchase agreement by Adani Power (Mundra) Limited.</p>
<p>In September last year, the Curative Bench led by CJI Ramana had, in a rare move, issued notice to the Adani group and decided to hear the case in open court.</p>
<p>However, both the GUVNL and Adani reached an amicable settlement of the 1000 MW power purchase agreement in January 2022. It was reported that the Adani group had decided to waive the Rs. 12,000 crore compensation that the GUVNL was ordered by the Supreme Court to pay in 2019. Following the settlement, the GUVNL and Adani moved the Supreme Court jointly, seeking modification of the 2019 judgment.</p>
<p>Prior to the case reaching the SC, the GUVNL had won its challenge against the termination in the Gujarat State Electricity Regulatory Commission.</p>

<p>A special court in Mumbai on Tuesday allowed the National Investigation Agency (NIA)’s plea to send phones of seven accused in the Bhima Koregaon caste violence case of 2018 to the Supreme Court appointed committee looking into the allegations of unauthorised surveillance of Pegasus.</p>
<p>On October 27, 2021, the Supreme Court had constituted a technical committee comprising of Prof. Naveen Chaudhary, Prof. P Prabhakaran and Prof. Ashwin Gumaste overseen by Justice R.V. Raveendran, former judge of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The technical committee requested the director general of the NIA on January 30, 2022 to arrange for mobile phones of accused – Sudha Bharadwaj, Rona Wilson, Hany Babu, Shoma Sen, Anand Teltumbde, Vernon Gonsalves and Varavara Rao as it was informed to the committee that their phones have been allegedly infected by the Pegasus spyware.</p>
<p>Digital copies</p>
<p>The NIA’s application mentions, “The committee will make the digital copies in the presence of the officer producing the same and return the instruments immediately thereafter a set of copies of the digital images will also be made available to the officer producing the mobile instruments. The digital copies of the said mobiles will also be furnished to the advocates for the purpose in custody.”</p>
<p>On December 17, 2021, a report was released by the U.S. forensic investigation firm Arsenal Consultancy that revealed that accused Mr. Wilson’s cell phone was attacked by the Pegasus spyware 49 different times and was successful in infecting his phone before his arrest on June 6, 2018, in the case.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has mocked the Maharashtra government’s initiative to help the poor during the pandemic, the Congress party said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The Congress party and our State government took steps to help people in distress during the first wave of COVID. We provided them food, shelter and tickets to take them to their home so they can live with their loved ones. The BJP and Modi were busy lighting lamps and banging thalis at that time. The PM has made fun of workers and their poverty. He has made fun of Maharashtra’s efforts to help the poor...,” State Congress president Nana Patole said, adding that even the BJP leaders in the State should protest.</p>
<p>Mr. Modi’s remarks during his reply to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address to both Houses of Parliament drew sharp reactions.</p>
<p>NCP Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule in Delhi said: “Mentioning Maharashtra as a super spreader of Corona was not only unfortunate but an insult of voters who had voted BJP in Lok Sabha polls to make you (Modi) Prime Minister.” She said the PM’s speech should have provided direction to the country for future, but instead he had insulted Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Stating that Railways came under the Central government, Ms. Sule said: “It was the Centre’s decision to arrange trains. The then Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and former CM Devendra Fadnavis have been praising the Railways for the same.”</p>
<p>“When Shramik Trains started, can the nation forget how these poor labourers who were left with no income were being charged for ticket? The State government stepped in to pay their fare,” tweeted Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi earlier on Monday.</p>
<p>Defending Mr. Modi, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar accused the three other parties of being instrumental in spreading the coronavirus in the entire country.</p>
<p>“These three parties are real anti-Maharashtra. These three parties brought the poor on road and made them go to their homes despite the COVID situation,” he said.</p>

<p>The 2022 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh would be a one-on-one contest between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the BJP along the lines of the West Bengal polls, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Tuesday. She appealed to voters to beware of “vote-cutter koels” and ensure there was no division of anti-BJP votes.</p>
<p>Ms. Banerjee, addressing a press conference along with SP president Akhilesh Yadav, asked voters to ensure that “bhai Akhilesh” wins over 300 seats in the 403-Assembly. She explained to people the significance of defeating the BJP in U.P. at the national-level.</p>
<p>“If you want to save the country from the BJP, you must completely support the SP and Akhilesh. If the BJP goes from this State, it will go from the entire country,” she stated.</p>
<p>In Bengal too, the BJP tried to use money power to divide votes but the contest was “one is to one.” “U.P. will also be one-on-one,” she observed, raising the slogan “khela hoga” in support of Mr. Yadav’s anticipated triumph.</p>
<p>“The fight in U.P. is a fight for izzat [honour],” she said.</p>
<p>Though Ms. Banerjee did not take any names, she hinted at Congress general Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi, and asked voters to not “waste your vote on koels (a bird known for its distinctive loud calls)” who descend upon U.P. close to elections from Delhi and Hyderabad. She said that if Yogi Adityanath is elected to power again, he would “eat up” the people politically and financially.</p>
<p>Mr. Yadav referred to the Bengal polls and hailed Ms. Banerjee for defeating “communal forces” and setting an example by challenging and defeating the saffron party despite it deploying various tactics and its “full army” in Bengal. “Not just defeat the BJP in Bengal, your victory increased the honour of ‘nari shakti’,” he said.</p>
<p>The former Chief Minister asserted that all regional parties would work together to remove the BJP from Delhi. “The BJP will be reminded of its defeat in Bengal.”</p>
<p>Mr. Yadav also took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the cancellation of his Bijnor rally due to bad weather. While Ms. Banerjee had arrived in Lucknow from West Bengal, “Dilliwale” could not come to U.P., he said.</p>
<p>“The BJP’s clouds of crisis are getting darker. The weather is bad for the BJP. The BJP’s plane of lies will not land in U.P. this time,” he said. On March 3, Ms. Banerjee is expected to campaign in Varanasi.</p>

<p>Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is in New Delhi, issued the order on closure of schools and colleges and tweeted, “I appeal to all students, teachers and managements of schools and colleges, as well as people of Karnataka, to maintain peace and harmony.” He appealed to all those concerned, especially students, to patiently wait for the court’s verdict. He reminded them that they have to sit together in colleges and carry on with educational activities, and hence, it was important to maintain harmony. He strongly defending the recent order of the government on dress code in colleges.</p>
<p>The Opposition has, meanwhile, lambasted the BJP government for escalation of the issue and “colleges turning into battlefield.” Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah in a series of tweets said, “Hijab-Kesari issue could have been resolved harmoniously at the local level. BJP in Karnataka, which politicized the issue, is now clueless on how to control the situation.” He added that students were suffering because of “ulterior political motives of the BJP.”</p>
<p>JDS leader H.D. Kumaraswamy said the controversy has diverted the focus of the State from many challenges it faces and vitiated the atmosphere in colleges. “I appeal to both communities not to encourage organizations that are fomenting trouble,” he said.</p>

<a name="cong.-speaking-the-truth-has-scared-pm"></a><h2 id="cong.-speaking-the-truth-has-scared-pm"><span class="header-section-number">5.17</span> Cong. speaking the truth has scared pm: rahul</h2>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attack on the Congress in his speeches in Parliament shows that he is “scared” of the Congress for telling the truth, Wayanad MP and former party president Rahul Gandhi said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Responding to the strident attack by Mr. Modi on the Congress including India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister can keep ‘abusing’ them but he must discharge his prime ministerial duties well.</p>
<p>The Congress leader also said neither Pandit Nehru nor any other member of his family, who gave their entire life for the country, needed a certificate from anyone.</p>
<p>“...If you like abusing the Congress, if you like abusing Jawaharlal Nehru, be my guest, keep doing it, but do your job,” Mr. Gandhi told the Prime Minister while speaking to reporters outside Parliament just hours after Mr. Modi’s speech in the Rajya Sabha.</p>
<p>Mr Gandhi said the Prime Minister didn’t address the three key issues raised by him in the Lok Sabha last week: the growing economic divide and the creation of two Indias; regular attacks on independent institutions and a foreign policy that has brought Pakistan and China together.</p>
<p>“There is a little bit of fear inside as the Congress speaks the truth. They [the BJP] have a network of friends who do their marketing and spread lies. But there is fear inside and it was visible in Parliament. His entire speech of him was on criticising Congress, Jawaharlal Nehru but Prime Minister did not say about the promises made by the BJP,” Mr. Gandhi said.</p>
<p>Earlier, in the day, the Congress accused Mr. Modi of lowering the dignity of the President’s Address and accused him of using Parliament as a platform to make an election speech.</p>

<p>“I will tell you what would have happened if Congress wasn’t there — democracy would have been devoid of dynastic influence, we would be rid of foreign influence, there would be no Emergency, no caste and regional divide, no Sikh genocide would have taken place, Kashmir Pandits wouldn’t have been displaced, daughters would n’t have been killed in tandoor [oven] and common man would not have had to wait for years to get basic amenities,” he said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s repeated attack on the Congress during his 96-minute speech forced the party members to walk out in protest after an hour or so.</p>
<p>Without naming former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Modi targeted his Lok Sabha speech in which Mr. Gandhi referred to India as a union of States. “Congress has a problem with ‘nation’ also. If [the word] nation is unconstitutional, then why is your party’s name Indian National Congress. Change it to Federation of Congress. Correct the mistakes done by your predecessors,” he noted.</p>
<p>Continuing his attack, Mr Modi said the Congress’s top leadership knew three ways of functioning - discredit, destabilise and dismiss - and cited examples of State governments were “dismissed” in the past.</p>
<p>“Tall statements were given on federalism, have we forgotten how Chief Ministers were removed on flimsy grounds, a PM’s son did not like the arrangements at the airport so the then Andhra Chief Minister was removed, Karnataka’s Virendra Patil was removed while he was unwell,” he said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister cited the goods and services tax (GST) Council and his 23 meetings with the Chief Minister during the pandemic as examples of cooperative federalism adopted by his government.</p>
<p>Mr. Modi also questioned the liberal credentials of the Congress by recalling the instances of Lata Mangeshkar’s brother Hridaynath Mangeshkar being sacked from All India Radio for presenting a poetry on Veer Savarkar and lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri being jailed for criticising former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.</p>

<p>Mr. Jaishankar tweeted separately that he had received a call from his Korean counterpart, and discussed bilateral and multilateral issues “as also the Hyundai matter”.</p>
<p>Some of the companies that had issued the Kashmir posts have subsequently withdrawn and deleted their posts, and a few like Hyundai and KFC expressed their apologies and “regretted the offense caused to the people of India”.</p>
<p>“[Hyundai] has already issued a clarification. Yesterday, we have also asked them to be more forceful in their unequivocal apology on this issue,” Mr. Goyal stated while responding to a zero-hour submission made on the subject by Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi.</p>
<p>In its statement on Tuesday the Hyundai Motor Company said that it “does not comment on political or religious issues in any specific region. Therefore, it is clearly against Hyundai Motor’s policy that the independently-owned distributor in Pakistan made unauthorised Kashmir-related social media posts from their own accounts”.</p>
<p>In response to calls by Indian social media users to boycott Hyundai products, it also said that Hyundai Motors India was “not associated with the distributor in Pakistan”.</p>
<p>Japanese auto giant Suzuki Motor Corporation, in a statement put up by Maruti Suzuki on its Twitter account, said that it aimed to be a company trusted and counted upon by all throughout the world.</p>
<p>“As a corporate policy, we do not align with any political or religious inclination in any part of the world. Such communication from our dealers or business associates on these topics represents neither our company position not authorised by us. We deeply regret the hurt to sentiments, that such insensitive communication has caused,” it stated.</p>
<p>On Monday, KFC India issued an apology “for a post that was published on some KFC social media channels outside the country”.</p>

<p>A week after the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme received a Budget allocation 25% lower than the previous year’s revised estimates, a Parliamentary panel has pulled up the government, noting that Budget estimates for the Centre’s flagship rural jobs scheme have failed to keep up with proven demand for the last four to five years.</p>
<p>“Budgetary Allocation of a scheme of such enormous magnitude should be done in a more pragmatic manner so that there is no dearth of funds in mid-year, and flow of funds for payment of wages, material share, etc. is maintained seamlessly,” said a critical evaluation of the scheme presented to the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Rural Development spotlighted the failure to pay unemployment allowances and also recommended a hike in wage rates and in the number of days of guaranteed work, and a revision of the 60:40 wage-material ratio under the scheme. The panel, chaired by Shiv Sena MP Prataprao Jadhav, adopted the report at its last meeting on February 4.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has renewed the FCRA (Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act) registration of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), a public health advocacy group, the Lok Sabha was informed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The move comes four years after the organisation was barred from receiving foreign funds for lobbying with parliamentarians, the media and the government on tobacco control issues.</p>
<p>The PHFI’s FCRA registration was cancelled in 2017, days after Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), the economic arm of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) brought out a ‘white paper’ on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s (BMGF) influence in India’s health sector. The BMGF was a major contributor to the NGO, having transferred Rs. 183 crore to it between 2010 and 2015. The FCRA registration, renewed in 2017, was valid till 2021.</p>
<p>Revoked in 2018</p>
<p>The PHFI’s registration was partially revoked in 2018 and it was placed under the “prior permission” sanctioned list. It effectively meant that the organisation had to obtain prior permission from the MHA before acceptance of each foreign contribution. The latest move means that the PHFI could receive foreign funds in its designated bank account without the additional ring of check by the MHA.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha, said, “since November, 2021 the FCRA certificate of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), New Delhi and Missionaries of Charity (MoC), Kolkata was renewed by way of revision.”</p>
<p>The Minister was responding to a question by members Vijayakumar and T. R. Paarivendhar on the number of NGOs whose FCRA was recently restored.</p>
<p>On December 31, the MoC was among 6,000 NGOs whose registration had ceased to exist. FCRA registration is mandatory to receive foreign donations.</p>
<p>The Minister said that about 5,800 FCRA registered associations had not submitted their applications for renewal within the stipulated time and their registration was ceased.</p>

<p>A student was hurt in stone-throwing at the Government Pre University College in Rabakavi Banahatti of Bagalkot district after the hijab-saffron shawl issue turned violent.</p>
<p>Unidentified people threw stones at the college after a row erupted in front of it during a protest by two groups of students. Some boys came to college wearing saffron shawls and demanded that they should be allowed inside classrooms.</p>
<p>When the college authorities refused to allow them saying that their dress was not in accordance with the uniform code, the boys said that the college had been allowing hijab-clad girls inside classes all these years, which was an obvious violation of the code.</p>
<p>“If these girls are allowed, then we should be allowed too,” they argued. They sat in protest in front of the college gate, demanding that the college authorities stop hijab-clad girls from entering the college.</p>
<p>In response, hijab-clad girls began a protest in front of the gates. After a few minutes, some people threw stones at the group and a boy suffered minor injuries.</p>
<p>The girls ran to safety. Police officers rushed to the spot and dispersed the crowd.</p>

<p>A student protesting against girls wearing hijab in classrooms climbed up the flag post of the Government First Grade College at Bapuji Nagar in Shivamogga city and hoisted the saffron flag. The flag post on the campus was meant for the national tricolor, hoisted on Republic Day and Independence Day.</p>
<p>Hundreds of students had gathered on the campus raising chants of “Jai Sriram”. They protested against allowing girls with hijab inside the college. As they were raising the slogans, one student climbed up the post and tied the saffron flag. The video clip of his act has gone viral on social media platforms. While a few people have argued that he replaced the national flag, those present at the venue said the post was empty at that point.</p>
<p>KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar said, “Today you see a saffron flag put in the place of the tricolour in Shivamogga. No Indian can tolerate this. The image of the country is at stake”.</p>

<p>The protests over wearing hijabs and saffron shawls in colleges turned violent in Shivamogga on Tuesday forcing the district administration to clamp prohibitory orders in the city until Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Hundreds of students took part in the protests against hijabs on college campuses, while those in support of hijabs took out a march. The protest turned violent as both the group came face to face on B.H. Road near the Science Field. A few protesters threw stones, leaving seven students injured. Many students with saffron shawls gathered at the Government First Grade College in Bapuji Nagar shouting ‘Jai Sriram’. They protested against Muslim girls wearing hijabs. The college staff let the girls inside and insisted that they remove their hijabs before attending classes. There were similar incidents at Government Pre-University College in the Science Field.</p>
<p>The district administration had deployed policemen at all colleges. They tried hard to disperse the mob and at times resorted to mild lathi-charge too. The policemen had a tough task in handling the crowd when the students went out of the campus and hit the streets raising slogans against each other.</p>
<p>Deputy Commissioner Selvamani R. and Superintendent of Police B.M. Laxmi Prasad visited the campus and took stock of the situation. Senior police officers including the SP were on the ground to handle the mob. At one point the SP appealed to the students to return home as their demands had been conveyed to the government.</p>
<p>The administration clamped the prohibitory orders as per Section 144 of the CrPC until Wednesday evening to avoid untoward situations in the city. The policemen went around the city informing the public about prohibitory orders in place. Mr. Selvamani, the DC, told The Hindu that the tahsildar of Shivamogga taluk had issued the prohibitory orders as there were a couple of incidents of stone pelting in the city. Later, MLA Hartal Halappa visited the government hospital in Sagar town where the injured were being treated. In presence of the MLA, a group of people assaulted a person. The MLA said he had spoken to police officers and the administration will take action against those disturbing peace.</p>
<p>In Chikkamagaluru, the teaching staff at IDSG First Grade College refused to allow students with scarves enter the college. The Muslim girls refused to remove scarves and demanded that they be allowed to attend classes. There also were many students with saffron shawls outside the college.</p>

<p>Sringeri tahsildar S.A. Prasad has filed a complaint against his predecessor Ambuja R. and five staff of the taluk office accusing them of creating false documents, criminal conspiracy, forgery and breach of trust. The police registered the complaint on February 6.</p>
<p>Ambuja R., the main accused, was Sringeri tahsildar until she was arrested by the ACB police on January 6. Other accused are revenue inspector Sandeep M.R., village accountants K.R. Sathish and Shivakumar V. Kavadi, and first divisional assistants Prakash R. and Sharath Kumar T.S..</p>
<p>Following allegations of corruption and irregularities in granting and regularising residential properties in the taluk, ACB police had caught village accountant Siddappa taking a bribe from a villager on January 6. Later, they arrested Ambuja R. as well. This development prompted Chikkamagaluru Deputy Commissioner K.N. Ramesh to order a probe into allegations of irregularities in the taluk office, by a team of officers headed by Assistant Commissioner Dr.H.L. Nagaraj.</p>
<p>S.A. Prasad, the complainant, said between May 11, 2020, and January 6, 2022, the accused issued fake grant certificates without following the procedure. Flouting the law, they regularised houses in forest land, soppina betta, gram thana and regularised properties where houses are yet to be built. The accused caused a huge loss to the Government. They had not collected reports from their subordinates concerned before taking any decision.</p>
<p>Even as the inquiry was on, Vijeth, the tahsildar’s driver died by suicide. He had left a note alleging harassment by some officials in the taluk office.</p>

<p>Telangana High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to consider issue of allotting double bed-room houses to transgenders if they come under the eligibility category.</p>
<p>Disposing of a public interest petition (PIL) petition, a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili said the government can consider allotting 2BHK houses to transgenders if they fulfill terms and conditions laid down in GO Ms no. 10 issued in 2015.</p>
<p>While hearing contentions of counsel of the government and the petitioner, the bench sought to know if there was any rule making transgenders ineligible to secure 2BHK houses built by the government.</p>
<p>Special Government Pleader Radhiv Reddy informed the bench that there were no such rules.</p>
<p>He, however, clarified that a person must fulfill conditions contemplated in GO Ms. no. 10 to be eligible to get 2BHK house.</p>
<p>The SGP said there was no discrimination against transgenders in allotment of houses.</p>
<p>The petitioner’s lawyer contended that the State government invited applications for allotment of houses only from those who had Food Security Card.</p>
<p>The transgenders were not issued any such cards and they were losing the opportunity of allotment of the houses, he told the bench.</p>

<a name="row-over-dress-code-in-more-colleges"></a><h2 id="row-over-dress-code-in-more-colleges"><span class="header-section-number">6.9</span> Row over dress code in more colleges</h2>
<p>The row over dress code impacted three more colleges in the coastal belt on Tuesday forcing them to declare a holiday even before the State Government announced a three-day holiday in this connection.</p>
<p>The colleges declared a holiday to bring the tense situation under control after some students turned up with saffron shawls with saffron peta and hijab.</p>
<p>Hence, the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) Pre University and Degree Colleges, both situated on the same premises, in Udupi and the Government First Grade College at Vamadapadavu, Bantwal taluk in Dakshina Kannada, declared a holiday.</p>
<p>Founded in 1949, MGM Degree College is an A grade accredited college by the NAAC and is a well-known institution in the coastal belt.</p>
<p>Some boys and girls wore both saffron peta and shawls while some girls were seen wearing either saffron shawls or hijab on the premises of the two MGM colleges.</p>
<p>Though the situation on the college campus was tense for some time in the forenoon as the students gathered inside the campus and protested against each other, it eased after the college declared a holiday.</p>
<p>The students dispersed gradually later.</p>
<p>MGM Degree College principal Devidasa Naik told presspersons that the campus of the colleges is a healthy one.</p>
<p>The issue over hijab has provoked the students of the colleges which then declared a holiday to bring the situation under control.</p>
<p>The colleges, both the pre university and degree sections, will remain closed till the management committee takes a decision on re-opening classes.</p>
<p>A student, Varshi, who was sporting a saffron shawl, told mediapersons outside the college in Udupi that students wore the shawls and peta as some students turned up wearing hijab. The college told students on Monday that neither shawls nor hijab will be allowed in classrooms.</p>
<p>But some students turned up with hijab on Tuesday also. “Hence, we too wore saffron shawls. We want equality and uniformity,” she said.</p>
<p>Asked whether students were wearing hijab earlier to college, she said that they did. “But as per the Government Order now, it is not allowed,” she added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a row erupted in Dakshina Kannada on Tuesday with some students, both girls and boys, of Government First Grade College at Vamadapadavu in Bantwal taluk turning up on campus sporting saffron shawls.</p>
<p>They shouted slogans that the college should not allow girls wearing hijab inside classrooms.</p>
<p>Noticing that the situation was getting tense, the college immediately declared a holiday for two days.</p>
<p>Registrar (Administration) of Mangalore University C.K. Kishore Kumar told The Hindu that the colleges which have declared a holiday have been suggested to conduct online classes.</p>
<p>Another degree college in Dakshina Kannada, Pompei College at Aikala, had witnessed a row over dress code about a month ago. The controversy was mutually resolved later after students agreed to attend classes wearing uniform.</p>

<a name="alternative-dispute-resolution-centre-"></a><h2 id="alternative-dispute-resolution-centre-"><span class="header-section-number">6.10</span> Alternative dispute resolution centre settles cases worth rs. 4.62 crore</h2>
<p>The Alternative Dispute Resolution Centre (ADR) set up by the Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) at its office here so far has facilitated a settlement of disputes between various litigating parties worth Rs. 4.62 crore.</p>
<p>Supreme Court judge S. Abdul Nazeer inaugurated the centre in March 2020. The pandemic affected the smooth functioning of the system.</p>
<p>However, once the pandemic was brought under control, it started full-scale operation in 2021. In less than a year of functioning, it has handled several cases primarily on business and commerce matters, president of KCCI Shashidhar Pai Maroor said in a release on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The centre is designed to settle disputes outside of the courtroom with the help of an impartial third party. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, which governs the settlement of disputes outside court, has been made relevant and current with a plethora of amendments.</p>
<p>The amendments have facilitated the improvement of institutional arbitration by establishing an independent body to lay down standards, making the arbitration process more flexible and cost-effective and ensuring the timely disposal of cases.</p>
<p>“We have made a conscious effort to ensure that arbitration proceedings do not mimic court proceedings and disputes are settled after giving enough chances to both parties to narrate their side of the story,” Mr. Maroor said.</p>
<p>All the cases settled by the centre have been achieved within 90 days of admission, which is by far a record considering the long years one has to suffer in a court of law, the KCCI said.</p>
<p>As head of the ADR focus area of KCCI, Lionel Aranha said: “Alternative dispute resolution is here to stay. The centre has attracted cases from the industry and has ensured that resolutions are found quickly and efficiently.”</p>
<p>The centre was the brainchild of the fromer president of KCCI, Isaac Vas, who said: “We invite litigating parties to avail of the services of the centre to bring a lasting settlement to their long-pending disputes.”</p>
<p>According to the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), 4.11 crore cases are pending in all courts across India, of which 1.08 crore are civil cases.</p>
<p>Therefore, the country needs an estimated 50,000 more judges to dispose them of in time which has become challenging to all incumbent governments. Considering this, in many cases, courts themselves encourage arbitration and reconciliation to provide justice to citizens.</p>

<p>Deputy Director of Social Welfare Siddalingaiah B. and District Officer for Backward Classes Welfare Sachin Kumar said that the students underwent medical test and those who are physically fit were selected for the training. “Most of the students are undergoing the training,” Mr. Kumar said.</p>
<p>A Karate Black-belt holder has been appointed for each one of the schools and hostels to train students. The training session is of one-hour duration and it is being held twice a week.</p>
<p>“Initially, there were some niggles. But now the trainees have got used to the training schedule,” Mr. Kumar added. For each session, the trainer is paid Rs. 500, he said.</p>

<p>Deputy Leader of the Congress in the Legislative Assembly U.T. Khader said on Tuesday that the State Government should conduct a thorough inquiry to identify those who initiated, instigated and invigorated the entire row over hijab.</p>
<p>Mr. Khader, who is an MLA from Mangaluru, said in a statement that the Government has lost control over the law and order situation in the State. The Government should immediately arrest those seen causing disturbance and restore peace on campus.</p>
<p>“By sowing the seeds of hatred between communities and individuals, the only agenda of the BJP and the RSS is to create polarisation for their electoral gains,” he said.</p>
<p>“This time, they targeted students. College campus is meant for education and growth. Students are being used by right wing organisations with the tacit approval of the Government to resort to violent acts of destruction and hooliganism,” Mr. Khader said. He said that after its failure to tackle COVID-19, “the State Government has once again failed, this time, to tackle a communal virus.”</p>

<p>Minister for Muzrai, Haj and Wakf Shashikala Jolle said on Tuesday that a Rs. 300-crore project proposal for the integrated development of Kukke Subrahmanya Temple, managed by Endowment Department, is ready. It will be placed before the State Cabinet soon for its approval.</p>
<p>Speaking at a meeting to review the development projects taken up at the temple at Kukke Subrahmanya, she said that the project proposal has been made a part of stage three master plan for the development of the temple.</p>
<p>The Minister said that the project proposal has been finalised after discussions in Bengaluru and at Kukke Subrahmanya. The projects will be taken up once the Cabinet approved them.</p>
<p>She said that in-principle approval has been given to develop a gou shala (shelter for cows) on 100 acres of land near the Snana Ghatta in Kukke Subrahmanya. No trees will be cut for the project as the land identified is a forest land. The officials concerned have been directed to prepare a detailed project report for this.</p>
<p>The Minister said that A and B grade temples should submit their audit reports every year. But only four temples in the State were submitting them regularly. The executive officers of other temples were served notices on November last to submit the audit reports annually.</p>
<p>She said that the Kukke Subrahmanya Temple has not been submitting its audit report to the government regularly since 2012-13. After a notice was served on the temple, it has submitted reports for three years. It has been directed to submit the reports of the other years by March 31 this year.</p>
<p>The Minister asked the temple authorities to take steps for the disposal of cases pending before courts. Slots for Ashlesha Bali and Sarpa Samskara should be increased, she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Jolle said that a proposal has been submitted to the government to recruit 60 Home Guards for providing security at the temple. She will try to get approval for this. The Minister said that the Muzari Department has begun developing 25 temples in the State under the Daiva Sankalpa Scheme.</p>

<p>The Maharani’s NTM School was demolished under police protection late on Monday night to pave the way for construction of the Vivekananda Memorial amid a strong protest by activists of Kannada and progressive organisations.</p>
<p>The demolition of the building housing the school, which is believed to be more than 130 years old, was preceded by the shifting of the furniture and other equipment a week ago.</p>
<p>On Monday night, earthmoving equipment was deployed to demolish the structure even as activists, who had been agitating to save the school under Maharani’s NTM School Horata Samithi, reached the spot and physically tried to prevent the building from being razed.</p>
<p>A few activists even lay down before the earthmover, but the police took them away. Several activists including S.R. Sudarshan, Hoskote Basavaraj, Ugra Narasimhe Gowda and others were bundled into a vehicle and arrested by the police who were deployed in large numbers.</p>
<p>The controversy over the issue dates back to over a year after a proposal was mooted to construct a memorial for Swami Vivekananda, who had visited Mysuru in 1892 and stayed at Niranjana mutt. The Maharani’s NTM School, however, is situated in the same premises as the mutt.</p>
<p>The government, which merged the school with other nearby institutions, transferred the land to Ramakrishna Mission that had been entrusted with the responsibility of constructing the memorial for Swami Vivekananda, but pro-Kannada activists strongly opposed the demolition of the school building.</p>
<p>The matter went to court, but the HC gave a ruling in favour of Ramakrishna Mission. However, the activists continued to bring pressure on the government to save the school, which is reckoned to be among the earliest schools for girls, by bringing a law to bypass the court order.</p>
<p>The proposed memorial is expected to function as a cultural centre for youth, housing a meditation centre, yoga training centre and facilities for competitive examinations, and a library to help the student community.</p>

<p>A group of volunteers has brought life to a village school in H.D. Kote taluk that had not seen paint for many years, by turning it into a bright and colourful structure.</p>
<p>An NGO, Upkriti, brought together volunteers from diverse professions for the task. The facelift of the Government Higher Primary School at Gandhinagar in the taluk was completed within a span of 30 hours.</p>
<p>“We have now decided to construct two toilet units and a lunch hall on the school premises. If anybody is interested in funding the units, the volunteers are ready to execute for them in the interest of schoolchildren,” said Chandan N., who heads the NGO.</p>
<p>The facelift includes waterproof painting on walls, coloring ‘nali kali’ classroom, donation of computers and so on. Cartoon characters have been painted on the walls of ‘nali kali’ classrooms.</p>
<p>Seeking nothing in return, the volunteers gave their time on the weekend to help children enjoy their schooling, he said. They included professional artists, engineering students, advocates, software engineers.</p>
<p>Mr. Chandan, along with volunteers Manasa, Kruthik, Sushmitha, Amrutha, Darshan, Medha, Prakruthi, Kiran, Sanjay, Naushin, Tahreen, Vishal, Lohith, Inchara, Harsha and artist Yellapa gave a facelift to the school campus on February 6 and 7, drawing appreciation from the school authorities and the villagers.</p>
<p>The initiative was sponsored by Mr. Balasubrahmanyan and Ms. Sawarnalatha from Mysuru.</p>

<p>The late-night demolition of NTM School, a government-run school, on N.S. Road in Mysuru has come under sharp criticism with those in favour of saving the historic Kannada school expressing shock as several writers and progressive organisations had been urging the government to safeguard it.</p>
<p>“The demolition of NTM School has come as a shock. It is nothing but back-stabbing by the government,” said Malavika Gubbivani, district president, AAP Mysuru.</p>
<p>“Activists trusted the government and believed that talks were still on, but the government went ahead and demolished the school, that too at night, demonstrating a cowardly approach. For years, people of Mysuru have been urging the government and elected representatives to protect and improve the NTM School. Unfortunately, successive governments and politicians of all parties — Congress, BJP and JD(S) — have failed to protect the school. This shows how much these politicians value education, ”she said.</p>
<p>At a time when more government schools are needed and the focus should have been on improving the infrastructure and quality of education in government schools, AAP accused the BJP government of doing the exact opposite. The CM could have single-handedly saved the school if he had the resolve, Ms. Gubbivani held. With the demolition of the historic school, a part of Mysuru’s history — the dawn of education for the girl child in Karnataka — has been erased, she opined.</p>

The girl, as seen in videos that have gone viral, raised her hand in response to the sloganeering directed at her by the boys.</p>
<p>She is later seen in a video complaining about the treatment meted out to her before she made her way to the classroom. The incident took place in PES College of Arts, Science and Commerce situated on Mysuru-Bengaluru highway.</p>
<p>The girl, talking to media later, said five other girls who came to the college with hijab, were also subjected to similar treatment and reduced to tears.</p>
<p>However, she said she received support from not only the college principal and other staff, but also her Hindu classmates. She denied that she was feeling unsafe and added that education is her priority while lamenting the efforts made to ruin education in the name of attire.</p>

<a name="macron-sees-path-to-ease-russia-crisis"></a><h2 id="macron-sees-path-to-ease-russia-crisis"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Macron sees path to ease russia crisis</h2>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he saw a path forward on easing tensions with Russia over Ukraine, after conducting an urgent round of shuttle diplomacy between Moscow and Kiev.</p>
<p>Mr. Macron held talks with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kiev a day after a five-hour meeting at the Kremlin with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, as the West scrambles to defuse fears Moscow could invade its ex-Soviet neighbour.</p>
<p>The French leader said he now saw the “possibility” for talks involving Moscow and Kiev over the festering conflict in the east of the country to move forward, and “concrete, practical solutions” to lower tensions between Russia and the West.</p>
<p>“We cannot underestimate the moment of tension that we are living through,” Mr. Macron said at a joint press conference after meeting Mr. Zelensky.</p>
<p>“We cannot resolve this crisis in a few hours of talks,” he said. “It will be the day and the weeks and the months to come that will allow us to progress.”</p>
<p>Summit talks</p>
<p>Mr. Macron — who now heads to Berlin for talks with the leaders of Germany and Poland — said Mr. Putin had told him that Russia “would not be the source of an escalation”, in the situation, despite amassing more than 1,00,000 troops and military hardware on Ukraine’s border. Mr. Zelensky said he hoped a meeting of high-ranking officials on Thursday in Berlin could pave the way for a summit with the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany aimed at reviving the stalled peace plan for Kiev’s conflict with Moscow-backed separatists.</p>
<p>Mr. Putin — who has demanded sweeping security guarantees from NATO and the United States — said after his talks with Mr. Macron that Moscow would “do everything to find compromises that suit everyone”.</p>
<p>He said several proposals put forward by Mr. Macron could “form a basis for further steps” on easing the crisis over Ukraine, but did not give any details.</p>
<p>French proposals</p>
<p>At the same time as sending its military hardware to Ukraine’s borders, Mr. Putin has issued demands the West says are unacceptable, including barring Ukraine from joining NATO and rolling back alliance forces in eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The French presidency said Mr. Macron’s counter proposals included an engagement from both sides not to take any new military action, the launching of a strategic dialogue and efforts to revive the peace process for Ukraine’s conflict.</p>
<p>It also said an agreement would ensure the withdrawal of some 30,000 Russian soldiers from Belarus at the end of joint military exercises later this month.</p>
<p>The Kremlin insisted that it never had any intention of leaving the troops permanently on Belarusian territory. The West faces a tough task trying to convince a wary Mr. Zelensky to accept any compromises.</p>
<p>Kiev has laid out three “red lines” that it says it will not cross to find a solution — no compromise over Ukraine’s territorial integrity, no direct talks with the separatists and no interference in its foreign policy.</p>
<p>As Mr. Macron sought a diplomatic solution with Kiev, U.S. President Joe Biden ramped up the pressure on Moscow on Monday by warning he would “end” the controversial new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Europe if tanks rolled into Ukraine. Mr. Biden’s declaration at a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was the bluntest so far on the fate of the massive pipeline, which is complete but has yet to begin funnelling natural gas.</p>

<a name="sri-lanka-to-launch-its-own-aadhaar"></a><h2 id="sri-lanka-to-launch-its-own-aadhaar"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Sri lanka to launch its own ‘aadhaar’</h2>
<p>India has agreed to provide a grant to Sri Lanka to implement a ‘Unitary Digital Identity framework’, apparently modelled on the Aadhaar card. The Rajapaksa government will “prioritise” the implementation of the Framework as a national level programme, Sri Lanka’s Cabinet decided on Monday.</p>
<p>“Under the proposed Unitary Digital Identity Framework, it is expected to introduce a personal identity verification device based on biometric data, a digital tool that can represent the identities of individuals in cyberspace, and the identification of individual identities that can be accurately verified in digital and physical environments by combining the two devices,” according to a statement released by the Department of Government Information on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The initiative follows bilateral talks between President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December 2019.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka’s Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal made by Mr. Rajapaksa, in his capacity as the Minister of Technology, to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with India, in order to obtain the grant and take the project forward.</p>
<p>It also comes amid substantive economic assistance from India — totalling $ 1.4 billion since the beginning of this year — to Sri Lanka, to help the island nation cope with its dollar crunch, and import food, medicines and fuel amid frequent shortages.</p>
<p>While India has confirmed support for Sri Lanka’s effort to transition to a digital identity system, there is no official information yet on the value of the grant, and whether it would include technological support or training. Queried on the specifics of the agreement, Colombo-based official sources said the terms of the agreement are “being worked out”.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Sri Lanka is attempting to digitise its citizens’ identities. Just a few years ago, the predecessor Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe administration, in power from 2015 to 2019, mooted a similar Electronic-National Identity Card — or E-NIC —that privacy advocates opposed on grounds that the state would have full access to citizens’ personal data in a central database.</p>
<p>The former Mahinda Rajapaksa government tried initiating the project as early as 2011. Neither project was implemented.</p>

<p>The EU on Tuesday unveiled a plan to quadruple the supply of semiconductors in Europe by 2030, hoping to limit the bloc’s dependence on Asia for a key component used in electric cars and smartphones.</p>
<p>The production of chips has become a strategic priority in Europe as well as the United States, after the shock of the pandemic choked off supply, bringing factories to a standstill and emptying stores of products.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of semiconductors overwhelmingly takes place in Taiwan, China and South Korea and the European Union wants factories and companies inside the bloc to take on a bigger role.</p>
<p>Chips Act</p>
<p>The highly anticipated EU Chips Act will “mobilise more than €43 billion ($49.1 billion) of public and private investments” and “enable the EU to reach its ambition to double its current market share to 20% in 2030”, the European Commission said.</p>
<p>“We’ve set ourselves the goal to have 20% of the global market share of chips production here in Europe,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Getting to that level “means basically quadrupling our efforts” given the huge increase in global demand, she said.</p>
<p>If approved, the EU plans could generate a total of €43 billion via existing EU budget money as well as by loosening existing rules on public subsidy from member states.</p>
<p>Approval of members</p>
<p>The proposal will need the approval of the EU member states and European Parliament, where opinions will vary between the ambitions of industrial heavyweights such as Germany, France and Italy and those of smaller states that are worried about closing off valuable supply chains with Asia.</p>
<p>Some member states, led by the Netherlands and Nordic nations, will also resist any plan to widen the scope for state aid, with the commission planning to make it easier for EU governments to pump money to chip-makers.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to end up in a position with a huge U.S. company getting a bunch of EU money to open a factory in one big member state,” an EU diplomat said.</p>

<p>The people of Sri Lanka “increasingly recognise ” that India is a true friend that Sri Lanka can rely on at all times, Foreign Minister G.L. Peiris has said, thanking India for the $2.4 billion assistance at a “critical juncture” for the island nation in the midst of an economic crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Peiris on Tuesday concluded his two-day visit to New Delhi, where he met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla. His visit coincides with India releasing urgent financial assistance to Sri Lanka since the beginning of this year, including a $400 million currency swap, a $500 million loan deferment, a Line of Credit for $500 million for fuel imports and another $1 billion currently under negotiation. Particular attention was drawn to the energy security of Sri Lanka, a statement issued by Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, referring to the recently signed Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm deal, that Mr. Peiris said, signalled “a closer integration between the two countries, resulting in substantial benefits; a win-win situation for both”.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministers discussed the Palk Bay fisheries conflict and reiterated the longstanding consensus to handle fishermen issue through “humanitarian approach and refrain from the use of violence”. They agreed that bilateral mechanisms should meet early, starting with the Joint Working Group on Fisheries, the India’s Ministry of External Affairs said. The statement from the Sri Lankan side said Mr. Peiris, in his meetings, termed it a “flashpoint” and “a recurring issue” assuming a “different complexion”, alluding to recent clashes between fishermen of both countries.</p>

<p>Bharti Airtel on Tuesday reported third-quarter consolidated net profit slid 2.8% to Rs. 830 crore, after network operating expenses and finance costs rose from a year earlier and the company prepaid Rs. 15,519 crore to the government to clear past dues.</p>
<p>The telecom operator’s revenues, however, rose 12.6% to Rs. 29,867 crore. Network operating expenses jumped 17% to Rs. 6,499 crore, while finance costs increased almost 10% to Rs. 4,367 crore.</p>
<p>“We have delivered another quarter of sustained performance across all our business segments,” Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO, India &amp; South Asia, said in a release. “Overall sequential revenue growth was at 5.4% and EBITDA margins came in at 49.9%,” he added.</p>
<p>Observing that a recent tariff revision for mobile services had gone down well and the firm’s ARPU (average revenue per user) had increased to Rs. 163, Mr. Vittal said: “The full impact of the revised mobile tariffs, however, will be visible in the fourth quarter”.</p>
<p>“Our balance sheet is robust and we are now generating healthy free cash flows. This has enabled us to recently prepay some of our spectrum liabilities to the Government thereby reducing the interest burden,” the CEO added.</p>
<p>Bharti said it prepaid Rs. 15,519 crore to clear all deferred liabilities for spectrum acquired in 2014.</p>
<p>The company, which serves about 485 million customers across 16 countries including in Africa, said its India mobile services business continues to garner a strong share of 4G customers. 4G data customers climbed 18.1% to 195.5 million, with average data usage per user at 18.3 GBs/month.</p>

<p>Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan hit out at global rating agencies’ comments about India being the most indebted emerging market and about the lack of clarity on a fiscal consolidation path in the Union Budget, arguing they appeared to adopt ‘double standards’ in their assessments of emerging economies and developed markets.</p>
<p>“I say this with a sense of seriousness and responsibility, not in a flippant way, that rating agencies do have double standards between emerging and non-emerging countries. Fitch [Ratings] has said that we have one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in emerging market countries,” Mr. Somanathan said, asserting that India had ‘one of the best’ debt-to-GDP ratios when compared with higher-rated countries.</p>
<p>“Our debt-to-GDP ratio is far lower than the United States, Japan, and other such highly-rated countries in Europe. Our denominator in terms of GDP has a natural tendency, even in the worst of times, to grow faster than those AAA-rated countries. Even if you forget India’s inherent fundamentals and go by pure mathematics, with a nominal growth rate of 10% to 12% and a 4% inflation rate, our deficits are far less worrying than some of the deficits of much higher-rated countries,” the Finance Secretary told The Hindu.</p>
<p>‘Ratio will decline’</p>
<p>“Ultimately it boils down to the debt dynamics, the numerical dynamics... We are very clear that the debt-to-GDP ratio must decline and it will decline,” he asserted.</p>
<p>Fitch, which maintains a negative outlook on India, had said the country had limited fiscal space to respond to shocks, with the highest general government debt ratio of any ‘BBB’-rated emerging market sovereign at just under 90% of GDP’. The Budget, offered ‘less clarity’ on the medium-term fiscal outlook and ‘few details’ on how the 4.5% of GDP fiscal deficit target would be achieved by 2025-26, it said.</p>
<p>Moody’s Investors Service, which termed the Budget a ‘credit positive’ for India’s sovereign rating, said the path towards the medium-term deficit target was undefined, even as government debt would increase to about 91% of GDP next year. Mr. Somanathan, however, pointed out there was no need to assume ‘ambiguity’ on this front.</p>
<p>“The glide path has already been provided in last year’s Budget, that we will reach a deficit of 4.5% of GDP in FY26 with an approximately even path of consolidation, and this Budget reiterated we are committed to that path,” he said, asserting that a statement by the Finance Minister in Parliament was as visible a glide path as one could get. To get from 6.9% in 2021-22 to 4.5% by ’25-26, entails an approximately 60-basis points reduction a year on average.</p>
<p>“In 2022-23, we are consolidating by 0.5%. So we may be 0.1% off that trajectory... but marginal adjustments have been made that seem to be desirable in terms of promoting growth now,” he said. “So, there is a path that is stated, is feasible and we are on course to meeting it,” he underlined.</p>
<p>The Finance Secretary said bond yields spiking was a ‘normal response’ to an expanded borrowing programme in a ‘well-run and efficient’ market, but emphasised that part of the spike in yields had happened even ahead of the Budget in response to global conditions such as high oil prices, inflation and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s taper programme to replace quantitative easing.</p>
<p>“Yes, an additional supply of bonds will affect yields... but the balance that the government had to strike was at the margin,” he said, referring to the dilemma between fretting about a small increase in yields and tightening fiscally at a juncture where some more expenditure is desirable to promote growth.</p>
<p>‘Savers will be happy’</p>
<p>While the Centre’s borrowing costs would rise sharply in FY23, the Finance Secretary said this was not at unprecedented levels. “Of course, we would like them to be as low as possible. But let me also remind you savers will be very happy when these rates go up. So everything has a positive side.”</p>

<p>After much speculation and delay, it was announced that the Ranji Trophy will return to the domestic calendar after a gap of two years.</p>
<p>The long format tournament, which commences on February 17, is the true test of skill and character. For the many cricketers who play only first-class games, it is also their sole source of income.</p>
<p>Crucial role</p>
<p>Karnataka bowling coach S. Arvind, who featured in 56 first-class matches in his playing career, understands the crucial role that the Ranji Trophy plays in shaping a cricketer’s career.</p>
<p>“The Ranji Trophy is a tournament where players enhance themselves as cricketers and human beings. This enhancement happens through discipline, concentration levels and other aspects that the long format demands.</p>
<p>“It is very important to have the Ranji Trophy commence again,” Arvind said here on the sidelines of a training session.</p>
<p>The Karnataka bowling attack is a mix of recognised names and new faces.</p>
<p>The pacers are led by Prasidh Krishna and Ronit More, while K. Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal. J. Suchith and K.C. Cariappa form the core of an experienced spin unit.</p>
<p>Speedsters M. Venkatesh, V. Vyshak and Vidyadhar Patil, and young left-arm spinners Shubhang Hegde and Aneeshwar Gautam are some of the newer faces in the squad.</p>
<p>“This is a transition time for Karnataka pacers. It happens every four to five years. We have a new set of bowlers who are going through a learning process.</p>
<p>“We have certain targets for them when it comes to red-ball cricket, and they have been achieving those targets in training and practice matches,” Arvind said.</p>

<a name="india-starts-favourite-to-seal-odi-ser"></a><h2 id="india-starts-favourite-to-seal-odi-ser"><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> India starts favourite to seal odi series</h2>
<p>A problem of plenty. It is one of the grand old cliches that sport outfits have thrown around for years. In a pandemic-struck world, with the squad size much larger than usual, this has turned into reality.</p>
<p>When India takes on the West Indies at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Wednesday in the second ODI in an attempt to seal the three-match series, Rohit Sharma and Co. will certainly have that problem when finalising its combination.</p>
<p>K.L. Rahul (personal reasons), Shreyas Iyer, Shikhar Dhawan and Ruturaj Gaikwad (COVID-19 affected) were unavailable for Sunday’s series opener. Since then, Rahul has had two hits in the nets, including Tuesday evening’s training, while Shreyas and Dhawan were out of isolation and had a light workout with the squad.</p>
<p>Dhawan and Shreyas though are highly unlikely to be considered for selection on Wednesday. Still, Rahul’s availability means India has plenty to ponder before the toss. At the time being named in the squad, Rahul was expected to bat in the middle order, as he has done frequently in the last two years in ODIs.</p>
<p>Kishan or Hooda?</p>
<p>With Dhawan’s unavailability, the team management will have to decide whether to use Rahul at the top along with Rohit or continue to let him play the finisher’s role. Depending on Rahul’s batting position it will be decided whether Ishan Kishan, who opened on Sunday, or Deepak Hooda, who batted sensibly on his ODI debut, will make way for the vice-captain.</p>
<p>Despite being drafted in as a possible batting all-rounder, Hooda was not required to bowl on Sunday. With the team struggling to find a reliable bowling option among the top six batters, it will be interesting to see if Hooda is persisted with at the cost of Kishan.</p>
<p>In the bowling department, with all five bowlers, especially the spin duo of Yuzvendra Chahal and Washington Sundar, putting up an impressive show, it’s unlikely that there will be a change in the line-up. Unless, of course, the management feels the need to rotate the pacers.</p>
<p>While India will be gunning to spin its web around the Windies, Kieron Pollard and Co. will be hoping to raise the bar and stretch India after a lacklustre opener. Pollard will hope the West Indies batters withstand the constant pressure applied by India’s bowlers so that he and Jason Holder can accelerate in the latter half.</p>
<p>Besides, the youngsters in the squad will obviously be looking to make a case for themselves ahead of the Indian Premier League auction set for the weekend. But if the conditions at the Motera continue to be as spin-friendly as they were on Sunday, the writing will in all likelihood be on the wall for the visiting outfit.</p>
<p>The teams (from): India: Rohit Sharma (Capt.), K.L. Rahul (Vice-capt.), Ishan Kishan, Mayank Agarwal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Deepak Hooda, Rishabh Pant, Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Washington Sundar, Shikhar Dhawan, Shreyas Iyer, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, and Avesh Khan.</p>
<p>West Indies: Kieron Pollard (Capt.), Nicholas Pooran (Vice-capt.), Fabian Allen, Darren Bravo, Roston Chase, Sheldon Cottrell, Dominic Drakes, Jason Holder, Shai Hope, Akeal Hosein, Brandon King, Kyle Mayers, Rovman Powell, Romario Shepherd, Odean Smith, and Hayden Walsh Jr.</p>

<p>India’s singles hopes at the Bengaluru Open ATP Challenger tournament rests solely in the hands of Prajnesh Gunneswaran, as all the other remaining home players, including Ramkumar Ramanathan, crashed out in the first round on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prajnesh defeated Frenchman Mathias Bourgue 7-6(4), 6-2 to set up a second-round meeting with top seed Jiri Vesely, who overcame a stiff challenge from Swiss qualifier Antoine Bellier 6-3, 6-7(2), 6-2.</p>
<p>Staving off set points</p>
<p>Prajnesh and Bourgue traded breaks twice in the first set before the former had to stave off three set points on his serve at 5-6.</p>
<p>The set slipped into a tie-break, but once there it was smooth sailing for Prajnesh, as the 2018 champion won the tie-break to four points and breezed through the second set.</p>
<p>The in-form Ramkumar, however, disappointed. In the last singles match of the day, he was beaten 3-6, 6-0, 7-5 by Aussie Max Purcell, a losing doubles finalist at the Australian Open.</p>
<p>Ramkumar, after having digested a second-set bagel, was up 4-2 in the third, only to lose five of the last six games to hand his opponent the victory.</p>
<p>In the capricious third set, Purcell was steady when he needed to be, even as Ramkumar paid the price for some erratic serving.</p>
<p>He served a whopping 11 double faults in the match and had a lowly first-serve percentage of 49.</p>
<p>Also on the day, qualifier Arjun Kadhe and wild cards Rishi Reddy and S.D. Prajwal Dev all bit the dust. Second seed Stefano Travaglia also crashed out, beaten by France’s Alexandre Muller 6-1, 7-6 (2).</p>
<p>The results (first round): Singles: Gabriel Decamps (Bra) bt Federico Gaio (Ita) 6-3, 6-3; Altug Celikbilek (Tur) bt Arjun Kadhe 6-1, 6-2; Borna Gojo (Cro) bt Rio Noguchi (Jpn) 3-6, 6-1, 6-2; Alexandre Muller (Fra) bt Stefano Travaglia (Ita) 6-1, 7-6(2); Jiri Vesely (Cze) bt Antoine Bellier (Sui) 6-3, 6-7(2), 6-2.</p>
<p>Cem Ilkel (Tur) bt Steven Diez (Can) 6-2, 6-3; Prajnesh Gunneswaran bt Mathias Bourgue (Fra) bt 7-6 (4), 6-2; Dimitar Kuzmanov (Bul) bt S.D. Prajwal Dev 6-2, 6-2; Evgeny Donskoy (Rus) bt Malek Jaziri (Tun) 7-6(10), 6-4; 6-Enzo Couacaud (Fra) bt Rishi Reddy 6-1, 6-3; Max Purcell (Aus) bt Ramkumar Ramanathan 3-6, 6-0, 7-5.</p>

<a name="of-captains-and-coaches-leading-from-t"></a><h2 id="of-captains-and-coaches-leading-from-t"><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Of captains and coaches: leading from the front and leading from behind</h2>
<p>When a coach or captain is fired (or pushed to resign, which is the same thing), one of two reasons dominate. Either the team has had poor results or the players are unhappy, whatever the results. England’s coach Chris Silverwood lost his job following a 0-4 result in the Ashes.</p>
<p>Ironically, the successful coach on the other side, Justin Langer, lost his job too — in his case largely because he lost the support of the senior players</p>
<p>In India, Virat Kohli, their most successful captain was pushed into resigning when he read the signs and decided they were not in his favour.</p>
<p>This tells us something about coaches, player power and the life-span of coaches and captains. Langer, who took over at a difficult time in Australian cricket following the sandpaper scandal in South Africa, managed to clean up some of the stains on the team reputation. He modified the team culture after the obsession with winning had pushed it over the edge.</p>
<p>Job done</p>
<p>More recently, his team won both the World T20 and the Ashes, so he could feel he had done his job.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is where the problem lay. Langer had done his job, and it was time for change. What pushed things to the point of resignation was the opinion of the senior players that he was a tough taskmaster and that he did not enjoy their confidence anymore. New skipper Pat Cummins concurred, and so it became a matter of priorities for the cricket board. The deciding body reckoned that Australian cricket needed Cummins more than it needed Langer, and that meant there could be only one conclusion to the drama.</p>
<p>Not unusual</p>
<p>This is not unusual. Some years ago the Indian cricket board decided that skipper Kohli was more valuable to it than coach Anil Kumble and threw in its lot with Kohli when the captain expressed his displeasure. Whatever the ethical issues involved, it boiled down to a practical one. The captain and coach cannot be at loggerheads. It is theoretically possible for a strong coach to push the captain out, but that happens less frequently. Then too the senior Indian players had felt that Kumble was a tough taskmaster. Ravi Shastri was recalled, did well, and continued till he reached the age-limit at which point Rahul Dravid, the current coach came into the picture.</p>
<p>Dravid can be a tough taskmaster too and can set the team’s agenda and settle its culture just as Langer — or Kumble in his brief spell — had done. His advantage is that India will have a new captain while most of the players passed through the junior ranks when he was the coach there.</p>
<p>Some captains and coaches work well together. This has more to do with man management than with cricketing expertise. The Greg Chappell-Sourav Ganguly partnership is an example of how quickly things can go wrong, despite a promising start. The captain led from the front, the coach from behind, and everybody else lined up behind one or the other.</p>
<p>In cricket, as in most professions, the coach or captain is chosen for specific skills. In different phases, sometimes these skills become irrelevant and other skills maybe required. When teams are at a low ebb, they need a rebuilder.</p>
<p>Once they have settled down, they need a consolidator. If a slide begins, they need someone who can turn things around quickly, and stand as a bulwark against erosion in team spirit and spiralling failures.</p>
<p>Some excellent rebuilders may not be sound consolidators while a captain who is the boy on the burning deck might lack the skills to put out the fire.</p>
<p>Sometimes captains and coaches are terrifically good at one of the three jobs, or two of them. Most companies — and cricket teams are often run like professional companies — are unemotional about a sacking here or a replacement there that they think will make the difference. Sometimes a change for the sake of a change works too.</p>
<p>Few CEOs or coaches resign of their own volition because they think that is best for their company or their team. The signs are clearer when seen from the outside. Not all teams go through the three phases requiring three different sets of skills to set them right again nor are the phases so clear-cut.</p>
<p>That is what makes change so difficult to accept for one group of supporters while appearing inevitable to another. As always, whether with top companies or cricket teams, there is only one measure of success: the results.</p>
<p>The coach-captain relationship is a crucial one, but not one that has been studied in any great detail. When things are going well, no one wants to rock the boat; when things begin to appear shaky one or the other has usually compromised.</p>

<a name="bdfi-set-to-resume-activities"></a><h2 id="bdfi-set-to-resume-activities"><span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> Bdfi set to resume activities</h2>
<p>Overcoming the odds posed by the COVID-19 virus, the Breakdance Federation of India (BDFI) is all set to resume its activities in order to prepare its breakers for the Asian Games this year and the Paris Olympics in 2024.</p>
<p>The BDFI, which held the inaugural National breaking championships in Mumbai in October last, is keen to begin the year by holding the second edition of the National championships in Delhi on April 24 and 25.</p>
<p>“It was originally planned in February. We had booked the venue but the third wave of COVID disrupted our plans,” BDFI secretary Biswajit Mohanty, who is running the federation office from his home town Bhubaneswar, told The Hindu .</p>
<p>“After breaking got into the Olympics programme, the enthusiasm has increased worldwide. In India we have around 1000 to 1500 breakers.</p>
<p>“We received around 170 entries online for our first National championships. We took the help of Ukrainian 2017 World ‘Bboy’ champion Lussy Sky to prune it to 57 and had a physical event at the Andheri Sports Complex on October 30 and 31.</p>
<p>“We expect a better response this time. Holding it in Delhi will familiarise the new discipline to important sports administrators of the country. We are going to provide board and lodging, medal, prize money and training for free. Lussy Sky has agreed to come down for four days to train our breakers.”</p>
<p>The BDFI officials understand that they are running against time to handle multiple tasks – spreading the organisation throughout the country, conducting competitions regularly to give adequate exposure to the breakers and appointing an expert coach.</p>
<p>“We had selected three ‘Bboys’ and three ‘Bgirls’ but our breakers could not participate in the Paris World championships in December last due to COVID.</p>
<p>“Now they will compete in the World Games in the USA and the Asian Games this year. We want to see our breakers in Paris 2024 but they need to be guided by a good coach.</p>
<p>“Foreign coaches are not agreeing to come to India at this point in time. They are for online coaching. Also, their fees are very high. We hope the Government will support us and help the new discipline grow,” said Mohanty.</p>

<p>“With great difficulty, I have barely played five-seven games for India… but yes I am trying... whichever number I get to bat, I try and win the game for the team. Even if we bat first, I will do the same things. I will continue to express myself and be fearless as I always am.”</p>
<p>When asked about possible changes in India’s combination, he responded with a chuckle, saying “you have chosen the wrong person to ask.”</p>
<p>Later he was asked about sledging Kieron Pollard, the West Indies captain who is Suryakumar’s IPL teammate. The question took everyone back with Pollard having lasted just a ball on Sunday. “There wasn’t any time on Sunday since he was in a hurry to head back, I guess,” he said.</p>
<p>So what was the takeaway from the interaction? Suryakumar stressed that the Indian team will not get complacent and will be keen to the seal the series come Wednesday.</p>
<p>“We almost ticked all the boxes. It’s is a challenge to repeat what we did in the first game... let’s see, really looking forward to it,” he said.</p>

<p>The Indian women’s cricket team will get to fine tune its ODI World Cup preparations in a six-game limited overs series against hosts New Zealand, beginning with the one off T20 here on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The one off T20 is scheduled ahead of the five ODIs starting February 12. Though the team will be looking to win, it will also be approaching the 20-over game to get used to the conditions with the bigger goal for World Cup in mind.</p>
<p>ODI skipper Mithali Raj, who won’t be playing the T20I, said on Tuesday all the six games will be used to figure out the core players who will feature in the ICC event in March-April.</p>
<p>“It is a different format. The team will be looking forward to wining the game. Having said that, this T20 will also give a fair idea about the wickets, how the players are coping with an open ground,” Mithali said at a virtual media interaction referring to the windy conditions.</p>
<p>T20I skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who ended her lean run with the bat with a successful Women’s Big Bash League, will look to lead from the front on Wednesday. Though workload management has gained significance in COVID times, Mithali made it clear that it will be a secondary issue for them in the six games as it is important for fast bowlers to get used to the conditions.</p>
<p>“It will take them at least two or three games to get used to the conditions,” she said.</p>
<p>“We play to win but I look forward to giving some game time to the core players. It is important they find their rhythm before the World Cup,” Mithali added.</p>
<p>New Zealand skipper Sophie Devine also stressed on testing out a few players in the series against India. Both teams are sailing in the same boat as far as finalising their combinations are concerned.</p>
<p>On the eve of the game, Devine called India the “sleeping giants” of women’s cricket and said playing them will be an ideal preparation for the ICC showpiece.</p>
<p>The teams (from): India: Harmanpreet Kaur (Capt.), Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Yastika Bhatia, Deepti Sharma, Richa Ghosh, Sneh Rana, Pooja Vastrakar, Meghna Singh, Renuka Singh, Taniya Bhatia, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Poonam Yadav, Ekta Bisht, Simran Bahadur, Sabbhineni Meghana.</p>
<p>New Zealand: Sophie Devine (Capt.), Amy Satterthwaite (Vice-capt.), Suzie Bates, Lauren Down, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Hayley Jensen, Fran Jonas, Jess Kerr, Melie Kerr, Frankie Mackay, Rosemary Mair, Katey Martin, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.</p>

<a name="umran-malik-making-life-difficult-for-"></a><h2 id="umran-malik-making-life-difficult-for-"><span class="header-section-number">9.10</span> Umran malik — making life difficult for batters</h2>
<p>He came out of nowhere and delivered thunderbolts in IPL last year.</p>
<p>Among his fast and furious deliveries was the quickest ball — 153 kmph — by an Indian in that edition of the IPL.</p>
<p>Umran Malik is fast, in fact seriously quick. When he unleashed balls of fire for Sunrisers Hyderabad, the batters struggled to get into positions to negotiate the deliveries.</p>
<p>The sphere travelled too quickly to them, disrupting their footwork. And Malik’s mean and brutal short-pitched deliveries left their mark on the batters’ frame.</p>
<p>“I am my own inspiration,” declared Malik during a conversation with The Hindu on Tuesday. He is in Chennai with the Jammu &amp; Kashmir Ranji Trophy team.</p>
<p>Happening fast</p>
<p>Things are happening fast for the new kid on the fast lane. “I was a net bowler for India during the Twenty20 World Cup. It was a great experience.”</p>
<p>Then Malik travelled to South Africa with the India ‘A’ team. “I learnt a lot during the tour.”</p>
<p>Talking about his journey, the 22-year-old Malik said, “I come from Gujjar Nagar in Jammu. There are no facilities there, not even a ground.”</p>
<p>But then, he had the urge in him to bowl fast. He would venture into his neighbourhood and take part in the tennis ball competitions.</p>
<p>“I would bowl quick with the tennis ball and the batsmen would struggle to score off me. That gave me confidence.”</p>
<p>Soon Malik’s speed and potential were noticed and he was drafted into the State under-19 side.</p>
<p>Irfan Pathan connect</p>
<p>There he met someone who would play a major role in his career. “The Ranji Trophy and the under-19 practice was happening in adjacent nets and I would approach Irfan Pathan bhai for inputs.”</p>
<p>Malik revealed, “And Irfan bhai would take time out and teach me the skills. When I was doing something wrong, he would correct me by making me bowl with a shorter run-up.”</p>
<p>And Malik, when travelling, would send videos of his bowling to Irfan who would respond promptly. It is a relationship that has blossomed.</p>
<p>Natural seamer</p>
<p>At his best, Malik is a lovely, natural seamer with a rhythmic run-up and an explosive side-on release.</p>
<p>Jasprit Bumrah is his favourite paceman among current Indian seamers. “I like his yorkers and slower ones in particular.”</p>
<p>His sights are set high. Representing India is prominent in his list of priorities.</p>
<p>Watch out for Malik. He bowls like the wind.</p>
<p>I would bowl quick with the tennis ball and the batsmen would struggle to score off me. That gave me confidence</p>

<p>Bengaluru Torpedoes notched up an exciting 14-15, 12-15, 15-13, 15-9, 15-14 win over Kochi Blue Spikers in the Rupay Prime Volleyball League (PVL) at the G.M.C. Balayogi Stadium here on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The first set saw Blue Spikers stage a terrific fightback after being down 7-14 and claim the next eight points, thanks to substitute T.R. Sethu’s splendid show.</p>
<p>He not only came up with big, powerful serves but also excelled at the net in the company of experienced captain A. Karthik and Colton Cowell.</p>
<p>In the second, Blue Spikers took charge after breaking away at 8-8 as Sethu continued to excel. Deepesh, Cody Caldwel and Cowell worked in tandem at the net to nullify the striking prowess of the opposition.</p>
<p>However, Torpedoes fought back in the third set thanks to the brilliance of captain Ranjit Singh, who was declared the player-of-the-match, Lavmeet Katariya, Pankaj Sharma and G.S. Varun.</p>
<p>The team took a comfortable 6-2 lead in the fourth before Deepesh Kumar Sinha and Cody scripted a fightback for Blue Spikers.</p>
<p>But, Varun and Pankaj’s power game and Ranjit’s wonderful display at the net saw Torpedoes win the set and take the contest into the decider.</p>
<p>It was anybody’s game in the final set before the consistent Deepesh of Blue Spikers had to limp off with a left ankle injury with the score reading 5-3 in his team’s favour.</p>
<p>Torpedoes rode on some fine work from Lovemeet and Pankaj to clinch the set and the match as the Kochi outfit suffered its second straight defeat.</p>
<p>The result:</p>
<p>Bengaluru Torpedoes bt Kochi Blue Spikers 14-15, 12-15, 15-13, 15-9, 15-14.</p>

<p>India ODI captain Mithali Raj says the team is benefiting immensely from the presence of sports psychologist Mughda Bavare during its ongoing tour of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Mithali had earlier also spoken on the need for a psychologist to deal with pressure of knockout games but with tours now being played in bubbles, the professional help is needed all the more.</p>
<p>“In today’s times, it is even more important to have them around with the team with the longer duration of tour and quarantine and bubbles,” said Mithali.</p>
<p>“It is an extended tour of two months with the ODI series and the World Cup. It does help to have one-on-one sessions with (sports psychologist).</p>
<p>“You see things in a different way and it helps you to understand your own self, to find your own ways to deal with pressure and quarantine. To have somebody is always helpful,” she added.</p>
<p>Asked what she does during quarantine, Mithali said: “I read books, try to solve puzzles. Off the field, I try and divert my mind to other things.”</p>

<p>Vidit Gujrathi drew with group leader Levon Aronian and P. Harikrishna fell well short of proving his superiority over veteran Alexei Shirov in the fourth round of the FIDE Grand Prix chess tournament in Berlin on Monday.</p>
<p>With two rounds remaining in the league, Vidit and Harikrishna have two points each. They need to strike big when the action resumes after a day’s rest. Only the group leaders from the four four-player groups will advance to the semifinals.</p>
<p>Vidit needed 38 moves to hold Aronian for the second time in four days. Hari could not break Shirov’s defence in their marathon lasting 76 moves. The game ended when only the kings remained on the board.</p>
<p>Wesley So best placed</p>
<p>At the end of the round that produced three decisive games, Wesley So (3 points) appeared the best-placed aspirant to reach the semifinals. He posted his second win after facing fellow American Leinier Dominguez Perez. Vladimir Fedoseev and Daniil Dubov were the other winners.</p>
<p>At present, Hikaru Nakamura (Group A), Fedoseev, Radoslaw Wojtaszek (Group B), Aronian (Group C) and So (Group D) are the front-runners to advance to the knockout phase.</p>
<p>The results (fourth round):</p>
<p>Group A: Alexander Grischuk (Rus, 2) drew with Andrey Esipenko (Rus, 2); Hikaru Nakamura (USA, 2.5) drew with Etienne Bacrot (Fra, 1.5).</p>

<p>ATK Mohun Bagan ended the winning run of leader Hyderabad FC with a 2-1 victory in an ISL-8 fixture at Bambolim on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a keenly contested match, ATK MB scored through Liston Colaco and Manvir Singh in the space of three minutes while HFC pulled one back through Australian forward Joel Chianese.</p>
<p>In the opening period, ATK MB grabbed the initiative, making a few forays into the HFC box and forcing goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani to bring up a couple of desperate saves.</p>
<p>ATK MB’s first opportunity came in the 18th minute when a pass reached an unmarked Boumous, but he shot wide.</p>
<p>In the next minute, David Williams’ snap shot was cleared by Kattimani; the HFC custodian came to his team’s aid again when he thwarted a Colaco attempt in the 42nd minute.</p>
<p>Hyderabad, which started to find its rhythm late in the opening half, got a chance in the 30th minute but Nikhil Poojary’s effort was tipped over by ATK MB goalkeeper Amrinder Singh.</p>
<p>The ATK MB attack suffered a double blow as it lost two of its key players — Boumous and defensive midfielder Carl McHugh — to injuries in the opening half.</p>
<p>Colaco fetched the lead in the 56th minute, latching on to a pinpoint cross from Williams. The Kolkata side immediately scored the next one when Manvir was set up by a lovely chip from Finland midfielder Joni Kauko. Though Chianese scored for HFC in the 67th minute, the ATK MB defence held on firmly after that.</p>
<p>The result: Hyderabad FC 1 (Chianese 67) lost to ATK Mohun Bagan 2 (Colaco 56, Manvir 59) .</p>

<p>With just five matches remaining for both sides, they need to maximise the points haul from these games starting with this fixture.</p>
<p>Chennaiyin is eighth on the points table, one place ahead of Goa but quite some way off the leaders in its pursuit of a place in the knockouts.</p>
<p>Bozidar Bandovic’s men will come into the game on the back of a 0-1 defeat to Mumbai City FC.</p>
<p>The head coach conceded his side’s chances for a place in the semifinals now looks difficult but promised to put the best foot forward.</p>
<p>“It is difficult, but there is always a chance. We have to give everything. We have five more games. Last game, we made so many mistakes with the ball in our feet and under no pressure. This is one thing we need to fix for the future,” said Bandovic.</p>

<p>Touted as one of the favourites to become the new Australian head coach, former paceman Jason Gillespie, on Tuesday, said he is not interested in the top job and described Justin Langer’s departure as “heartbreaking”.</p>
<p>Gillespie, who is South Australia’s coach and also has the experience of guiding English county sides Sussex and Yorkshire, was touted as a potential replacement for Langer along with Trevor Bayliss, Ricky Ponting, Greg Shipperd and Michael Di Venuto.</p>
<p>“I am not putting myself up for any job. It’s nice to be thought of in that way but it’s certainly something I am not even thinking about entertaining,” Gillespie was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo .</p>
<p>“Everyone has been pretty disappointed with how it has all played out — pretty heartbreaking to see, to be honest,” the 46-year-old Gillespie said.</p>
<p>“But unfortunately, it is what it is.</p>

<p>“He felt he had something to offer Australian cricket. Cricket Australia felt differently.</p>
